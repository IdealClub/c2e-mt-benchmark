Bahrain Princess gets married for five years
The Princess of Bahrain, the Princess of Bahrain, married a US marine soldier, and was widely praised by US TV stations. However, this difficult marriage lasted for five years, but now it is now in Las Vegas, a desert gambling city.
Mei Li-an, a member of the Bahraini Royal Family in the Gulf states, took the risk of losing a military career. The marriage of the two was like a fairy tale, which once became the theme of a TV film.
However, according to a report in Las Vegas, only five years later, two people went to court to ask for a divorce.
They met in 1999, when they were also professional soldiers and were stationed in Bahrain.
After he got acquainted with this young princess, the two of them wiped out the sparks of love. As a result, his life changed dramatically.
Because the royal family prohibited the marriage of the little lover, he was forced to put on a jacket and put on a baseball cap. She secretly brought her out of the country and arrived in the United States.
After a difficult immigration lawsuit with the US authorities, the little two finally got married at the candlelight wedding church on the renowned Las Vegas road. At that time, he was 23 years old and the new lady was only 19 years old.
However, Johnson said that because Las Vegas, which is known as "the city of evil," has a lot of temptation, he and his parents have always had a lot of tension and rumours about his plot to assassinate him.
Johnson said that he had to wait for the hotel and the casino customers to make a living. However, he gradually became mired in the night of the gambling city, often late at night, and did not put his husband in the eyes of the night.
Mei Li-an went there a year ago.
He said: "She has come to the end."
Euro zone's economic indicators this week will show continued weakness in Europe's economy
Economists said that the economic indicators to be announced by the euro zone this week will show further evidence of weak economic confidence and a slowdown in economic output. On the other hand, British data are expected to show an increase in industrial activity.
They said that data on economic output in the largest countries in the euro zone will continue to show great fluctuations every month, but the long-term trend of economic output will show a slowdown in economic growth.
The most important economic indicator this week is expected to be set by the ZEW economic research institute, which is paying close attention to the market in Germany, and will provide evidence of the first economic confidence in Europe in December.
The ZEW index fell sharply to 3.9% from 1.3 percent in the previous month.
Economists say that the substantial appreciation of the euro will continue to have an impact on economic confidence in recent investigations, and there is no reason to predict a rebound in economic expectations.
BNP economists said: "considering the major factors leading to the decline in economic confidence, including the appreciation of the euro, the uncertainty of the global economy, and the worsening unemployment rate in the German job market, all are likely to drag down the future growth in the December survey, so it is unlikely that the index will be strong."
According to a survey conducted by AFP's financial news AFX news, this target will drop again to 11% in December, from 3.9% in the previous month.
However, tianer, investment bank of UBS, said that the ZEW economy in Germany is expected to fall to zero in December.
"The future of German economic activity is expected to continue, according to our view, as reflected in the survey of analysts and financial market participants," he said.
The Ukrainian crisis has caused tension to become an OSCE issue.
Russia has repeatedly accused the West of interfering with eastern European affairs. This is because the political crisis in Ukraine has become a focus of attention, and the annual ministerial meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which will be held tomorrow, will become the main topic.
The recent events in Ukraine may become an important issue during the two-day meeting held by the OSCE in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, where the forces of the West are gradually reaching out to some corner of Europe, such as the Baltic states, Georgia and Central Asia.
The Supreme Court of Ukraine had issued a dramatic verdict, which had led to a second round of voting in the recent presidential elections, and until that time the European Union had appealed to the member states of the OSCE to prepare the observers "to act with maximum speed and efficiency".
According to European sources, the number of observers sent by the OSCE may increase from the original 600 to 1,000 in the rescheduled election to be held on December 26 in Ukraine.
US Secretary of State Powell will participate in the OSCE annual meeting, which may be his last visit before he leaves office.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, French Foreign Minister Barnier, British Foreign Secretary Straw, and German Foreign Minister Fischer will also attend the meeting.
The OSCE membership includes 55 countries in North America, Europe and Asia, and will celebrate its thirtieth anniversary next year.
The organization, which was established in Helsinki in the past, has contributed to the end of the Cold War.
Bush's test of intelligence reform bill faces congressional vote this week
The intelligence reform bill to be passed by the US Congress this week is President Bush's ambitious policy plan to promote his second term of office, and he is facing a major test for the first time after his re-election.
The former Republican governor of New Jersey, who was responsible for investigating the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on September 11, 2001, said in a newspaper interview yesterday that the issue of the intelligence reform bill was that it had to be passed by Congress.
He said: "If the president and the Congress fail to properly handle these major issues, the Congress will become ineffective, and we will all be in trouble."
He told the Daily News in New York: "We have to wait a long time before we will have another bill, which will win the support of both the Senate and the Democratic Party and 80 percent of the public opinion."
A number of members of Congress said yesterday that if this historic reform bill failed, it would delay a thorough overhaul of the operation of the old US spy network system for several months, or even a few years, or even completely damage its survival.
Harman, senior Democratic Party member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on CNN yesterday: "If this bill cannot be passed this week, it will be aborted."
The congress will try again to pass the 2004 intelligence reform and terrorism prevention bill on the 6th and 7th, and then adjourn until early next year.
If the bill is not passed, the whole bill will be set aside, and it will only be redrafted by the Congress in 2005.
Ukrainian opposition insists on deep exploitation of the president's power to build a constitutional case
The pro-Western opposition of Ukraine today insisted that the opposition would not accept the constitutional reforms promoted by the outgoing president, kucama, before the resumption of the second round of presidential elections.
This constitutional reform will deprive the majority of the powers currently vested in the president.
After a second round of elections was held in the Supreme Court, it was announced that the election to be held on November 21 was invalid. After the successful election of the Central Election Commission on December 26, opposition leader Ziyou again came to a deadlock.
"If the constitutional amendment is passed in its present form, all the powers of the president will be transferred to Congress. This is unacceptable."
She told reporters: "We hope that the president will appoint the director of intelligence and the Attorney General so that we can fight corruption and remove the group that controls the politics and business of Ukraine."
Kucama, who maintains a close relationship with Russia, worried that the opposition might win the presidential election and pushed for the revision of the constitution before the resumption of the election.
Members of the opposition Congress yesterday refused to vote on the constitutional amendment proposed by the government. The Congress thus adjourned for 10 days.
According to the amendment to the constitution, with the exception of the prime minister, the minister of defence and foreign minister, the power of appointment of all heads of government will be transferred from the president to the Congress, and the forces currently in support of the government are close to the majority in Congress.
According to this amendment, the prime minister, the Minister of Defence and the foreign minister, who are appointed by the president, need to be approved by the Congress, and the Congress may also present their candidates.
Ukraine's political crisis enters third week, opposition calls for continued protest
In the third week as a result of the chaos caused by the presidential election, the opposition leader, inter alia, called for support for the masses to continue their street protests, surrounding the presidential palace and the government building until the outgoing president, prime minister Jankovic, and his cabinet, and take action to ensure that the upcoming presidential election will be fair.
Tens of thousands of their supporters have gathered in the capital city of Kiev for two weeks. They surrounded the government building. The people they displayed forced the Supreme Court to declare that the second round of the presidential election on November 21 was invalid.
This evening, he told the public that he should replace his government and reorganize the Central Elections Commission. In addition, Congress and kucama should agree to amend the election law in order to prevent election fraud.
In his speech at the opening of the election on December 26, he said: "Before these decisions are made, it is not possible to talk about the lifting of the siege of government buildings or the presidential palace.
For 14 days, the square has demonstrated its love for Ukraine and the civic awareness of millions of Ukrainian people who are able to defend their choice. "
He said: "We are going through a struggle of good and evil forces. The whole world is applaud for our victory, and the whole world is proud of Ukraine."
On the occasion of the opposition's increased pressure on the ruling authorities supported by Moscow, he said that Polish President Kwasniewski, Lithuanian President Adamkus, and Russian special envoy Ge lizrov are scheduled to arrive in Kiev on 6 July for another round of mediation.
Egypt announces breakthrough in peace in the Middle East
Egypt says that the Middle East peace agreement is expected to have a new framework.
It also indicated that it would be possible to send a new ambassador back to Israel in the near future to resume comprehensive diplomatic relations, which had been suspended for four years.
The Middle East News Agency of the Egyptian state quoted a "senior" Egyptian source as saying that the parties to the peace plan have gradually reached a consensus on a comprehensive reconciliation.
The Middle East News Agency said: "Egypt, Israel, Palestine and important international groups, such as the United States and the European Union, have reached an important understanding and agreed in principle to a comprehensive settlement of the conflict between Israel and Palestine."
Since the death of Palestinian leader Arafat last month, the international community has resumed the promotion of the Middle East peace policy, with a view to bringing an early end to the bloody conflict between Israel and Palestine for many years.
The Middle East News Agency said that officials predicted that "the preparatory work will be carried out until July, after which political action will be carried out."
The Middle East News Agency said that the parties concerned with the Middle East peace process, Israel and Palestine, as well as Egypt, the United States, Russia and several European countries, will meet in Washington.
It is expected that the meeting will include "a ceasefire between the two sides" and that the Palestinian Authority will "prevent attacks against Israel and strengthen its control over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank."
In this connection, the Middle East News Agency said that Israeli Prime Minister Sharon promised that "as long as the Palestinian Authority respects the ceasefire agreement and controls them, Israel will stop its military actions against the Palestinians."
More than 1 billion children in the world suffer from war and poverty
The annual report of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) today states that over one billion children, half of the world's children, suffer from poverty, war and the ravages of AIDS.
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) indicated that the child's right to a healthy and secure environment, as defined in the 1989 Convention on the rights of the child, was often jeopardized, in part because of the failure of governments to implement human rights and economic reforms.
In his annual report in London, the chairman of the Executive Committee of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Ms. Belle, said: "when half of the world's children grow up in hunger and unhealthy conditions, when schools become targets of attack and when the entire village is destroyed by AIDS, we are unable to deliver on the promises made to children."
He added: "The governments of too many countries are making deliberate decisions that will actually harm children."
The statistics compiled by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), in collaboration with researchers from the London School of Economics and the University of Bristol, reveal the horror of children in danger in most parts of the world.
Researchers found that about 640 million children in the world lack adequate shelter, 400 million children do not have access to safe drinking water, 270 million children do not have access to health care, and 140 million children, mostly girls, have never attended school.
Researchers point out that what is more serious is that at least 700 million children suffer from various forms of "serious exploitation", including lack of access to information and access to public health facilities.
According to the tenth annual report published today by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), war and AIDS have destroyed networks that usually protect children, and children have from time to time become the direct victims of war and AIDS.
China puts pressure on EU to lift arms embargo
The European Union today rejected Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's hope of putting an end to the pressure on China's arms embargo as soon as possible. However, he also said that he will strive to move toward the lifting of the 15-year embargo.
The Netherlands, which holds the rotating EU presidency, made the above remarks after the EU summit in China.
The Netherlands said that it was not necessary to speculate on how the European Union would put an end to the embargo.
The European Union imposed an arms embargo on Beijing after the Tiananmen massacre in 1989.
Although the issue of the arms embargo has cast a shadow over this China EU summit, the two sides still signed a number of agreements on trade and other aspects.
Both China and the EU have claimed that these agreements have strengthened the "strategic partnership" between them.
In a joint statement issued after a summit meeting with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, the EU said: "The European Union confirms its political will to continue its efforts to lift the embargo."
The statement said that the Chinese delegation "welcomes this positive message and believes that this message is beneficial to the sound development of a broad strategic partnership between China and the EU."
Wen Jiabao did not hide his displeasure at a press conference after the summit. He said the embargo "failed to reflect the partnership between China and the EU."
Wen Jiabao said, "the embargo is the result of the Cold War and does not reflect the current situation, nor does it reflect the partnership between China and the EU."
A number of EU countries, under the leadership of France, have promoted the lifting of the arms embargo, claiming that the ban is outdated.
Without enhancing the relevant laws of the European Union, people with insight in the EU are concerned that the lifting of the embargo may open up the flood gates for arms sales and contribute to China's military strength.
Dutch Prime Minister baknan said: "I explained that the EU has the will to lift the embargo, but I also pointed out that the lifting of the ban is related to the adjustment of the code of conduct for arms exports."
Preliminary study found that chloric acid may lead to breast cancer but no conclusion
A recent health study has pointed out that a kind of vitamin B "chloric acid" commonly used by pregnant women to prevent birth defects will increase the incidence of breast cancer.
However, researchers say the results of their research may only be out of chance, because other studies show that Ye acid actually reduces the possibility of breast cancer. Therefore, they appeal to pregnant women to continue taking such supplements.
However, the medical profession is well aware that this is an important contribution to the development of the embryo.
Studies were carried out by researchers from the universities of Bristol and Addis Ababa against 3,000 women who had been pregnant at the time of pregnancy in the 1960s at 5 mg or 0.2 mg, most of them in the second and third stages of their pregnancy.
According to the report published in the British Medical Journal, as of September 2002, the proportion of women who had taken 5 mg of Ye acid was twice as high as that of the placebo.
Researchers, one of the researchers, stressed that the result was only "preliminary... the purpose of which is to point out the path of further study".
He said, "it is entirely possible that this is an accidental result. Therefore, before we reach any conclusions, we must conduct further scientific research to review its relevance, if it exists."
Nasseri says that women who plan to become pregnant should continue to use chloric acid.
He said that there was a considerable gap between the current dose proposal and the "experimental dose".
According to the United Kingdom's health guidelines, it is hoped that women who are pregnant and in the first phase of pregnancy should take 0.4 mg per day, more than 10 times more than the doses taken by women in the study.
Ukrainian President Re-elects Two candidates with very different feelings
On the 26th of this month, the two competitors who will meet in the presidential election of Ukraine will be prepared for the first time.
A pro-Western opposition leader, Ziyou, expressed confidence in winning the election, while the current prime minister of Moscow, annukovic, said that he would no longer represent the "shameful" ruling party in the election.
At the same time, Russian President Putin changed his attitude toward Ukraine's accession to the European Union, saying that he would be glad to see Ukraine's entry into the European Union.
When asked about the number of votes he expected to win in the re-election, he said: "I think I should get about 60% of the votes."
On the other hand, annukovic, who can see his anxiety and anxiety on a number of occasions, responded directly to reporters' questions. In the end, he said only one sentence: "We will win in the name of God."
Annukovic, who was originally a successor to the president of the Republic of China, has now changed its direction and positioned himself as a candidate for confrontation with the opposition party and the ruling party.
He said, "in the past, I trust the cowards and traitors who worked under the government, but now I am very disappointed. This government is really shameful."
Kuito and opposition parties exchanged conditions to transfer part of the president's power to the National Assembly by amending the law so as to end the two weeks of opposition and political chaos in the opposition party which lasted two weeks since the presidential election on November 21.
Annukovic, who had originally won the election, was also declared invalid by the Supreme Court on the grounds that the election process was rampant. The election must be held again.
Powell's last visit to the Hague
US Secretary of State Powell held talks with EU leaders today, and the last time during his term of office was to devote his efforts to the unity of the United States and Europe.
Powell's European trip was aimed at repairing the diplomatic damage caused to the two sides by the Iraq war, and the Hague was its last stop.
Powell's visit may be his last official visit abroad during his term of office. The EU promised him that before US President Bush's visit to Europe in February next year, the EU would move toward resolving the tension between the two sides.
However, the differences between the two sides still exist.
Foreign Minister Bao of the Netherlands, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said: "We must strengthen our bilateral dialogue during President Bush's second term of office and restore our common position."
She believed that Europe and the United States had made some progress in "putting aside the difficult times of the Iraq crisis", but she also recognized that it is now a critical moment in the relations between Europe and the United States.
Bush will fly to Brussels on February 22 next year to meet with EU and NATO leaders.
Powell said that Bush's intention was to repair the cracks caused by the Iraqi factor.
Powell has visited Sofia and Brussels on this European trip, but the purpose of improving the relationship has been limited.
In Brussels, in particular, Powell criticized six NATO countries opposing the war for refusing to participate in Iraq's training mission, which has damaged the "credibility and unity" of the allies.
However, Powell still insisted that his meeting activities had demonstrated the US commitment to fully resume diplomatic relations.
Romanian president elected as Romanian President to prepare for government
In the midst of the fierce competition in the presidential election campaign, the mayor of Bucharest, an opposition candidate of the Romanian opposition, will face great challenges in the formation of a new government.
According to the final official results released today by the Central Election Commission of Romania, bashsieh, a candidate for the "Justice Truth Alliance", won 51.23 percent of the vote, and his opponent, Prime Minister nasas, won 48.77 percent of the vote.
Nasas admitted defeat in the election and congratulated Pakistan.
The outgoing president, ikogu, has also extended congratulations to Pakistan.
Nasas said that his Social Democratic Party will assist Pakistan in its accession to the European Union (EU).
The Social Democratic Party won the parliamentary election on the 28th of last month.
"Today, my top priority is to form a government that can continue to implement Romania's accession to the EU as soon as possible," he said, adding that Romania must strive to meet the requirements of joining the European Union (EU).
He stressed that the people of Romania should know the price to be paid for this integration and that the whole country should unite to ensure that Romania will not challenge this integration.
Romania has completed EU membership negotiations and is scheduled to join the EU in January 2007.
Pakistan also attaches importance to the fight against poverty, corruption and the independence of the judiciary.
The old story is not the same as that of the people of the Republic of China and the people of Turkey.
Making use of the opportunity of his visit to Istanbul to promote the new film "Alexander" in Istanbul, film director Olden Smith made an attempt to repair it with Turkey.
The classic "midnight Express," written by him, was awarded to the image of Turkey.
In an interview with him, he told AFP, "I have never thought that the script will be hostile to Turkey. This script is aimed at opposing injustice everywhere."
Since the opening of this winning project in 1978, Turkish public opinion has always condemned Swaziland.
This film was adapted from his memoirs.
In an attempt to smuggle drugs from Turkey, the American youth was arrested at Istanbul airport. After a lengthy legal process, he was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment in Turkey.
In Turkey, it is alleged that Swaziland has arbitrarily changed its origin to a script with the meaning of racial discrimination, and that every Turkish figure has been described as a bad egg in the show.
The scene was also filled with appalling scenes of prison rape and abuse.
Shi Dong admitted: "Perhaps because I was young at that time, and because I wanted to express my arguments too strongly, I had a bit of fanaticism and anger."
However, he added: "It was true that he had been raped in Turkish prisons. He was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment for relatively minor offences and was subjected to cruel treatment in prison, so that everything was based on facts."
Shi Dong said: "on a larger scale, Turkey is not the only country where the prison system is not functioning properly. There are similar problems in the United States."
Japan's economic growth may slow down next year
Because the appreciation of the yen and the widening gap between the rich and the poor are likely to destroy the kind of harmonious atmosphere enjoyed in the first half of this year, the Japanese economy may slow down and enter 2005.
After 10 years of stagnation, manufacturers' profits are high and consumer spending is strong, which has enabled Japan to regain confidence this year. However, analysts have directed their support for economic growth to China, despite the increasing political tension between Japan and China.
The evidence is gradually showing that the Japanese economy may drop briefly in early 2005. In particular, if industrial production continues to decline, manufacturers will adjust their stocks to avoid the backlog of stocks.
According to the recently adopted new statistical method, the Japanese economy has actually declined slightly in the first quarter of June, with only 0.1 percent growth in the period from July to September, and has just escaped from a technical recession.
At present, economists still have very different views on the rebound of the Japanese economy.
It is estimated that the growth rate of the Japanese economy will reach 2.3 percent in real terms in the current fiscal year up to March next year and in the next fiscal year.
They call 2005 "the year of recovery" on the grounds that the United States economy has returned to the recovery track in a healthy manner, and that the spending of Japanese consumers has compensated for the pace of the slowdown in exports.
A more pessimistic view is that the economists of the UFJ Institute estimated that the growth rate for the current fiscal year was only 1.8 per cent, and that the growth rate for the next fiscal year was even lower than 0.6 per cent.
They cited the "potential risk", which means that the profits of manufacturers have not led to an increase in personal income.
French Foreign Minister: peace in the Middle East will test French and US relations
French Foreign Minister Barnier said after meeting with US Secretary of State Powell today that the resumption of the Middle East peace talks will "test" their trans-Atlantic relations.
After the death of Palestinian leader Arafat, France called for the speedy convening of an international seminar to promote the Israeli-Palestinian peace process; however, there was no sign of agreement at the end of the meeting between Barnier and Powell.
Barnier flew from Paris to Washington to take part in a European Union summit with Powell and his successor, National Security Advisor Rice, to attend a European Union summit in Brussels.
Paris and Washington both agreed to mend the tension between the two countries after the United States entered Iraq last year. However, the differences between the two countries remain obvious in resolving the deadlock in the Middle East.
After a brief meeting between the US State Department and Powell, Barnier said: "We hope to improve the future relations between France and the United States and Europe and the Americas."
He said: "I believe the core of the relationship lies in our ability to promote the peace process between Palestine and Israel."
Barnier had earlier called for the early convening of an international Middle East seminar to take advantage of the "window of opportunity" that he claimed to have emerged after Arafat's death last month.
However, Powell is still unwilling to make a commitment.
He said that the two talked about Britain's plan to hold a meeting with the participation of Palestinians, but did not mention whether a broader international conference would be held.
US officials have indicated that their first task is to promote peace between Israel and Palestine and to ensure the smooth conduct of the Palestinian elections next month.
This election will result in a leader who can control Muslim militants and resume talks between Israel and Palestine.
Foreign Minister Machimura proposes that Japan and South Korea negotiate FTA in January of next year
Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura today proposed that Japan and South Korea start negotiations on the issue of signing a free trade agreement (FTA) in January next year.
According to a report by the current affairs News Agency, Machimura said in a meeting with South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Ban Ki-moon that the two sides should resume talks at an early date because both the Tokyo and Seoul authorities hope to sign a free trade agreement by the end of 2005.
Prior to the talks with Ban Ki-Moon, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun held a summit meeting on the 17th. Roh Moo-hyun urged the Tokyo authorities in the talks to be cautious on the issue of imposing economic sanctions against North Korea.
North Korea kidnapped several Japanese nationals during the Cold War. Prime Minister Koizumi is facing the huge pressure from the public to punish North Korea.
Following the conclusion of the Japanese researchers last week that the human remains provided by the Pyongyang authorities in support of the death of the two hostages were not the remains of the victims, the families of the victims were very angry.
Besides the issue of kidnapping, Koizumi and Roh Moo-hyun agreed unanimously that the six-party talks aimed at preventing North Korea from developing nuclear weapons should be resumed as soon as possible.
Since North Korea's secret development of nuclear weapons program started in October 2002, the six-party talks held earlier have not yielded concrete results.
North Korea subsequently boycotted the fourth round of six-party talks, which was originally scheduled to be held in September of this year.
The six sides of the six-party talks were South Korea, North Korea, the United States, China, Japan, and Russia, respectively.
Thai Prime Minister Dai Kissin is still optimistic that he will win the general election in February of next year.
On the eve of his arrival in 2005, Thai Prime Minister Dai Kissin was confident that he could win the second four-year term. However, his reputation had been damaged due to the failure to calm the bloody rebellion of the separatists.
The national election in Thailand is scheduled to be held on February 6 next year. He and his political opponents are actively preparing for the election. Most analysts believe that despite the serious violent clashes and the bird flu epidemic in the south this year, it is estimated that he will still win.
In Thailand this year, a total of 12 people have passed away due to bird flu. The bird flu epidemic has swept through most parts of Asia, but it is particularly serious in Thailand. The Thai government admitted that it had "made mistakes" in dealing with the epidemic.
However, it is not likely that this health problem will allow him to be re-elected; on the contrary, many people are asking him to what extent and what is the meaning of his election to the Muslim rebellion in the southern province?
The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, clyak, told Agence France-Presse: "The phenomenon here is that no matter how you look at him, he is now enjoying the support of the vast majority of the people."
He said: "However, the situation will start to collapse next year. If you look at the accumulation of wealth (his family and people around him), and the social injustice and violence," he said.
It is precisely because of the problem of social injustice and violence that there will be turmoil in most of the southern Muslims in the southern part of the country, and sporadic rebel incidents have occurred since the beginning of the month.
Since January this year, Muslim militants have targeted Buddhists, government officials and security forces in a gun battle. They also carried out bomb attacks and raids. As of now, more than 560 people have died and 100 others have disappeared.
Palestinian Cabinet Secretary alleged that Arafat was poisoned about a year ago.
Abderman, the cabinet secretary of the late Palestinian leader Arafat, revealed that Arafat was poisoned when he received a delegation of supporters at the headquarters of remara a year ago.
Abderman told the newspaper, "about a year ago, Arafat's strange thing happened on September 25, 2003.
At that time, the chairman shook hands with about 30 support representatives one by one.
Since then, the health of the president has gradually deteriorated. "
Arafat passed away from a French hospital on November 11 due to an unknown disease.
Some senior Palestinian officials believe that Arafat has been poisoned by people.
However, the French doctor stated that there was no medical basis for such allegations.
Just two weeks before the Iraqi delegation visited Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon's cabinet made a decision and decided to remove Arafat from office. However, it was not clearly stated what method was to be used.
This Israeli threat has prompted the people of the world to support Arafat's wave of solidarity, and Arafat has received several groups of supporters for this purpose.
Abderman recalled that "Arafat shook hands with these people and expressed support for Arafat, who was besieged by Israel."
On September 25 last year, Arafat met two groups one after another. One of them was a free driver group from the world, advocating peace, and the other a group of political activists.
Abderman pointed out that "on October 12 this year, Arafat was the last one to be sick and the symptoms were the same, and they were all symptoms of vomiting, lack of appetite, and similar symptoms of the common cold."
Bush admits training for Iraqi troops needs to be strengthened
US President Bush admitted today that the Iraqi troops were not ready to replace the US military, and warned that the general election scheduled for January 30 next year would not be the end of the serious riot in Iraq.
At a one-hour press conference, Bush also expressed his support for the Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. He firmly believes that the head of the Pentagon is "doing its best".
Bush said that he pledged to continue to cooperate with Russian President Putin, and said that this is the time to move toward the end of the Middle East conflict.
He also believes that the best way to deal with the problems of the surviving "evil axis" members in Iraq and North Korea is through foreign diplomacy.
In the wake of a series of car bomb attacks that occurred yesterday in the Iraqi Islamic Shiite city of Najaf and Kabala, which left 66 people dead and more than 200 injured, Bush admitted that the riots had caused the Iraqi people to pay the price, but he insisted that the election would be held as usual in January.
Bush issued a warning to the American people, and the Iraqi election "is only the beginning of the political process," and warned, "of course, I will not think that the process will be smooth."
Bush also admitted that the training results of the Iraqi security forces were mixed.
He said: "In times of intense fighting, they (Iraqi forces) will escape from the battlefield."
He said that such Iraqi forces would never be able to protect national security, which was unacceptable.
However, he believes that with the long-term training of the US military, the training of the Iraqi forces will bear fruit.
White House: Iraqi rebels attempt to destroy elections doomed to failure
A U.S. military base restaurant in Mosul, northern Iraq, was attacked by rebels at noon today, killing 22 people and injuring more than 60 others. White House spokesman mcrean said that the terrorist activities of the Iraqi rebels will become even more rampant, but these "enemies of freedom" will be eliminated.
Reports from Iraq pointed out that a single huge explosion occurred at the US military base restaurant at noon. At that time, the officers and soldiers were eating, resulting in heavy casualties.
The Iraqi interim government is scheduled to hold its first election since the demise of the Hussein regime on January 30.
The United States has dispatched more than 20,000 troops to protect security during the Iraqi election.
During the election, the total number of US troops stationed in Iraq will reach 150,000.
Mcrelan said that the closer it is to the election, the rebel rebels who support Hussein will create more terrorist attacks in an attempt to destroy the transitional government. They want to go back to the past, but "they will be wiped out and they are being wiped out."
In response to a recent public opinion poll, 56 percent of the American people believed that the Iraq war was "an unworthwhile war," 57 percent did not agree with President Bush's way of dealing with the situation in Iraq.
"Public opinion polls are a matter of time. We are continuing our work on the basis of the progress made in Iraq," he said.
Philippine political figure Parkinson's funeral sent out for burial
A large number of fans from the Philippines today took part in the funeral of the country's most famous movie star Park. The ceremony was carried out under tight security measures because of the fear of a riot.
At the age of 65, Mr. Park took part in the presidential election.
The coffin containing the remains of the park was escorted by a group of people buried under the escort of two white horses, passing through the streets of the capital, Manila.
Storm police were deployed around the southern Palace of Malawi in order to prevent violence from being carried out by the popular population.
These people accused President Arroyo of fraud in the presidential election on May 10.
The army has also raised a state of alert, because it has been reported that a coup d'閠at was about to take place in order to overthrow Arroyo and replace it with the widow of the park.
However, the funeral ended in a peaceful manner, and fans shouted the name of Mr. Park's name, FPJ, and waved the election posters he had used.
He died of a stroke and died on December 14.
When the coffin was winding up to the cemetery, the women and children who were crying were throwing flowers in the coffin.
As Minister of Justice Gong gonz\ x {5aee} Ez warned that some people might take advantage of the funeral to provoke the incident, and as a result, a large shipping container was used as a road block in the southern Palace, which is adjacent to the funeral route.
Gong gonz\ x {5aee} Ez said that a "reliable intelligence report" pointed out that some people were plotting to use the opportunity of burial and burial to incite people to oppose the government.
However, Lieutenant Colonel Basri, spokesman for the armed forces, said that after the military deployed troops to guard important areas, the coup plot was clearly lost.
Arroyo later walked out of the southern Palace of Malawi and extended his greetings to the local military police.
Armitage warns Syria of need to cooperate with the United States on the Iraqi issue
US Deputy Secretary of State Armitage today issued a warning to Syria concerning the development of the future relationship between Damascus and Washington, as well as whether Syria is willing to cooperate with the United States on the issues of Iraq and Lebanon.
Armitage once again exerted greater pressure on Syria during an interview with a reporter from Arab countries.
The State Council announced the contents of the interview earlier.
Asked whether the relationship between the United States and Syria is expected to remain tense, Armitage replied: "I naturally hope that the relationship will improve, but it depends on what the group of people in Azerbaijan will do."
The second figure of the US State Department pointed out that Damascus should implement resolution 559 adopted by the UN Security Council in September of this year, and cease all interference with neighboring Lebanon at an early date.
Armitage said that Syria's act was "not against the United States, but against the international community as a whole."
The reporter further asked whether the United States would refer Syria's refusal to cooperate when the UN Security Council discussed the issue of the continued presence of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon next January. Armitage's reply was: "We are most likely to do so."
On the issue of Iraq, Armitage admitted that Damascus had indeed taken some actions that were in line with the expectations of the United States, such as strengthening border patrols with Iraq and blocking the sources of the rebels' funds.
However, he also pointed out that Syria "needs to make greater efforts".
AIT and the Hong Kong Association for the Betterment of Hong Kong signed a lease for the new building of the lake
The new building is being designed for the early completion of the new building. It is hoped that the new building will be completed at an early date and in a safe and modern environment.
Douglas Paal and the secretary general of the North American Coordinating Committee, Chen Zhong, signed a 99 year land lease at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Taipei as the site for the new office building of the American Association in Taiwan.
The witness was the deputy director of the Taipei Office of the American Institute in Taiwan, Ge Tianhao, and the deputy secretary general of the North American Affairs Coordination Committee, Liu late, and Foreign Minister Chen Tangshan also attended the ceremony.
The American Association in Taiwan was established under the Taiwan Relations Act to handle the informal relations between the United States and the people of Taiwan and set up offices in Taipei and Kaohsiung.
Douglas Paal said in his speech that the American Association in Taiwan began to work with the North American Affairs Coordinating Committee and the Taipei city government more than a decade ago to find a piece of land for the construction of the new office building of the American Institute of Taiwan.
He said: At present, there is no room for the office of the Shun Yee road to look at the old and the old.
As far as the American Association for Taiwan is concerned, the move to a new office building will be a challenge. The American Association in Taiwan can concentrate its offices in all parts of the city and handle operations in a safe and modern environment.
He said that the new building is being planned and designed to become a new building for Taiwan. It has also become the pride of Taipei residents.
After the planning design has been completed, tenders for the construction of the construction contract will be carried out, and construction will start after the construction of the construction business. It is hoped that construction will begin in the next few years.
A spokesman for the American Institute in Taiwan said that the entire structure includes land rental, construction design, and so on. It is estimated that about US $160 million is expected to be completed in 2008.
Thousands of believers rushed to Bethlehem to take part in safety night mass
Thousands of believers are gathering in Bethlehem, the west bank of the Jordan River, in preparation for their safety night mass.
At the same time, the mainstream of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) appears to be expected to defeat Hamas in the Palestinian local elections held yesterday.
In the area of violent conflict, a gun battle broke out between Israeli forces and Palestinian gunmen in Gaza, killing three Palestinian youths.
Israeli settlements have sealed off a main road to protest the mortar attack on the quartering areas.
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Abbas was also allowed to go to Bethlehem, a town in the West Bank. This is the first time in the past four years that the Israeli authorities have allowed important Palestinian leaders to attend the festival.
After his return to the Palestinian area in 1994, the late Palestinian leader Arafat was often a guest at midnight in Bethlehem. However, since early December 2001, Arafat has been under siege by the Israeli army at Arafat's headquarters in regara.
The Latin elders of Jerusalem, who left Jerusalem later this afternoon, began their traditional journey to Manger Square in Bethlehem, where thousands of Christian believers and Muslims were already concentrated in the Manger Square.
Sabba is scheduled to deliver a speech to thousands of believers at the midnight mass held by the main church.
Before noon, the Manger Square was packed with those who were holding the festival. They continued to shuttle to and out of the main church. On the outside of the church, there were a variety of lighting and all sorts of decorations.
In particular, the Israeli authorities have relaxed travel restrictions to facilitate the travel of Christians from the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Israel to Bethlehem to participate in the safety night mass.
Putin says acquisition of yuks main asset is aimed at protecting national interests
Russian President Putin pointed out today that Russia's acquisition of the main assets of Russia's giant oil giant is to protect its national interests, and this is also the first re-nationalization of the Soviet era.
Putin said at a year-end press conference held by the Kremlin that the acquisition by Russia's state-owned oil company, yuxsk oil and natural gas company, said that "Russia is now using an absolutely legal market mechanism to protect its national interests.
I think this is perfectly normal. "
Russia's state-owned oil company today became the new boss of yudsk oil and natural gas company, following the acquisition of the Baikal financial group, which was previously marked in a secret auction by the state-owned oil and natural gas company.
At midnight last night, Russia's state-owned oil company suddenly announced that it had obtained 100% shares of the Baikal financial group that had not been heard before.
The acquisition action has enabled the Kremlin to firmly control Russia's important energy industry.
In the past nearly 18 months, the Russian authorities have been attacking UKs and its founder, hundreds of millions of rich people.
Russia's state-owned oil company is in the process of merging with the Russian state gas company, together with the oil and natural gas company, which will take control of one fifth of Russia's total oil production and its entire natural gas production, and become the largest energy group in the world at the same time.
In order to defend the country's current takeover operations, Putin denounced the operation of the "black box operation" in the 1990s.
The privatization measures at that time had caused the most precious assets of the Russian economy to fall into the hands of a small group of eight players, such as Khodorkovsky.
Baikal's previous bid was US $9350 million, which was bought at the power of the oil and natural gas company of yukursk.
Mrs Yau announced that he would win the presidential election in Ukraine.
The results of the preliminary election show that the leader of the opposition, the leader of the opposition, during the presidential election, was a leader in the presidential election. He also announced the victory, and its supporters gathered again today to celebrate the victory at the Independence Square in the center of Kiev.
"This is the only clean political victory," he said, "This is the only clean political victory."
He said: "This is a noble victory, and the people have demonstrated their strength. The Ukrainian people have stood up to confront the most violent regime in the eastern European countries, and today Ukraine's country and people have won the victory."
He said: "Over the past 14 years, we have been independent, but we have no freedom."
He said: "Today Ukraine has embarked on a new political era.
The era of kucama, the former president and the former prime minister, the former prime minister, has entered history, "he said.
According to the figures released today by the Central Election Commission of Ukraine, according to figures from more than half of the votes in the election, the leader of the opposition party, especially the leader of the opposition party, took the lead in this historic presidential election.
The Central Committee of Ukraine said that the pro-Western jubid section won 56.33 percent of the vote, while the pro-Russian ynukovic won 3986 percent of the votes.
The results of the survey are based on the ballot drawing results of 50.96 per cent of the country's ballots.
There are more than 33,000 ballot drawing centers in Ukraine.
In addition, according to earlier announcement of export polls, Ziyou was leading yunkovic with 15 to 20 percentage points.
Japan to make use of electronic transportation to reduce office living pressure
Japan's General Department of General Affairs began to promote an advanced network program today. It is hoped that by the year 2010, 20 percent of the Japanese labour force will be able to carry out "electronic commuting" through such plans, so as to reduce the pressure brought about by office life and the breakdown of the family.
A general department official said that at present there are about 4 million Japanese, that is, six percent of Japan's 63.2 million working population, using science and technology to work outside the office.
Starting from January, six staff members of the General Department will not be required to enter the office for at least one day. They can work at home, university or library through high-speed Internet service.
The General Department will then respond by expanding the scope of this advanced plan until all of the 2,500 employees in the general province will be able to work at home before 2006.
The General Department official said that this plan, which allows employees to meet at the Internet chat room and the electronic video conference, hopes to "increase the efficiency of the employment field."
He said that electronic transportation will allow more time for workers to get along with their families, so that those who have to pay for their families can also help more household chores.
He said that the scheme would also reduce traffic congestion, including the emission levels of vehicles and the problem of overcrowding at peak hours.
The aim of the plan, he said, is to "increase the rate of electronic communication between Japan and Japan by 10% to 10% by the year 2005, and to 20% by 2010," he said.
Pentagon launches unprecedented rescue operation for tsunami victims in Asia
The Pentagon said today that the Pentagon has launched one of its largest rescue operations to assist the tsunami victims in Asia, including the mobilization of two aircraft carrier battle groups, including a reconnaissance plane and a supply plane, and tens of thousands of people.
The U.S. military is facing the challenge of simultaneous operations in several regions following the tsunami disaster that caused the death of more than 80,000 people on the 26th, a spokesman for the Pentagon and commander of the navy.
"This is one of the largest humanitarian relief operations in the Pentagon," he told AFP.
The chief of staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Lieutenant General Conway, said that they are seeking to assess the scale of the disaster and have dispatched disaster relief assessment teams to Thailand, Sri Lanka and Indonesia.
The Pentagon said that the Pentagon has dispatched 20 aircraft to South Asia, including six C-130 transport aircraft carrying drinking water and food, five KC-135 tanker aircraft and nine P-3 reconnaissance aircraft.
The Pentagon has also mobilized the aircraft carriers of the "Linken" and "Li Cha", as well as the ships to which they belong.
He said that the "Lincoln" battle group and its 12 helicopters, as well as 9,000 personnel, have gone from Hong Kong to Guantanamo Bay and will eventually be deployed in the sea off Somalia.
A total of 25 helicopters, 2,100 marines and 1,400 sailors have departed from Guam and are expected to arrive in the Bay of Bengal by January 7 next year.
The Pentagon has decided to mobilize five additional vessels from Guam to mobilize two vessels capable of producing fresh water from the Indian Ocean.
Kangwei said that this rescue operation by the US military will be conducted as a command base in Thailand's wuta base in Guantanamo Bay.
At least 169 deaths and 375 injuries in Argentine capital night club fire
Officials from the Argentine capital city of Buenos Aires said today that at least 169 people were killed and 375 others injured in a fire at a night club in downtown Buenos Aires.
At the time of the fire, the night club was packed with about 2,000 young people close to the end of the school year.
The head of the municipal health department, Mr Stenton, pointed out that the above statistics are not final.
"This is a disaster! This is a disaster!" and warned that the death toll is only a temporary figure.
He pointed out that at least 375 people, including 18 police officers, were injured in the fire.
Shi Tan said that the disco, located in the center of the city, caught fire before midnight on the 30th. At the time, about 2,000 young people took part in the rock concert in the dance hall.
According to the mayor of Buenos Aires, the mayor of Buenos Aires stated that there were no confirmed reports that some people had dropped fireworks during the concert, causing the fire.
Let's tell the news TV station today that "this is a night of terror."
When the fire fighters tried their best to fight the fire, the remains of the victims were discharged on the streets.
The fire broke out in a state of chaos early this morning, when hundreds of police officers and firefighters were mixed with young people who were suffering from shock, as well as the anxious parents who were searching for their children in a disorderly manner.
UN: relief materials to be delivered to victims in Aceh for several weeks
The United Nations said today that the urgently needed relief supplies will be delivered to tsunami victims in isolated areas of Ingushetia after "several weeks".
The US Navy helicopter today arrived at the city of Grand Addis Ababa, capital of Aceh province. In addition, there are more and more field hospitals in the city, and a large number of relief supplies have arrived at the airport.
However, the head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Indonesia, Abby, told the reporter that because of the large number of problems in coordination and infrastructure, relief supplies could not be delivered quickly.
After returning to the capital of Jakarta in the city of arrogance, Abby told the reporter, "We need a few weeks before we can send relief supplies to all isolated areas."
"This is a worrying problem, and we are making every effort to establish a material distribution system for Aceh," he said.
The United Nations and other relief organizations have warned that if residents of Indonesia's Sumatra region do not have immediate access to clean water and food supplies and medical treatment, they may die in a few days.
He said: "I hope that the victims will find ways to get food and drinking water, but this is obviously not what we would like to see."
He said: "This is a very serious situation. We can only hope that it will be possible to speed up the operation."
Japan provides US $500 million in disaster relief to become the first in various countries.
Japan has pledged to provide US $500 million in aid to countries affected by the great tsunami in the Indian Ocean, and Japan has become the first to help the victims of the worst disaster in the world, and the total amount of relief and reconstruction pledged by the international community has increased to $1.6 billion.
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi issued a statement saying that as the biggest economy in Asia, Japan will also consider providing more aid, including money and technology.
He said: "Japan will do its best to provide assistance in three areas: financial resources, knowledge technology and human resources."
"Japan will first Grant US $500 million in donations to affected countries and relevant international organizations for emergency assistance in response to the disaster," he said.
Koizumi also indicated that he will attend a meeting of world leaders on the 6th in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta to discuss assistance to countries affected by the tsunami.
After being criticized by US President Bush for the slow response to the human disaster, the US government yesterday increased the promised amount of aid by 10 times to reach 350 million US dollars.
China, which has been considered increasingly to challenge Japan's influence in Asia, has also pledged to provide US $60.5 million in aid, which is a huge sum for the developing countries.
Koizumi said: "Japan will mobilize the helicopters and personnel of the Fire Services Department to make more contributions.
Japan will also consider making more efforts as soon as possible, including using the planes, ships and personnel of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. "
Japan had originally promised to provide 30 million US dollars in aid to countries affected by the tsunami.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the US $500 million that Koizumi said also includes 30 million US dollars.
World Health Organization: 50 groups to provide medical assistance to Indonesia
The World Health Organization said today that 50 aid groups have arrived in Indonesia's Aceh province to provide medical assistance to survivors who were hit by the tsunami.
The Indonesian representative of the World Health Organization (WHO), Peter Petersen, said who was trying to coordinate all groups and had a meeting with them this afternoon.
Peterson said that coordination is very difficult because many groups have gone directly to Aceh to carry out disaster relief.
He said in a telephone interview in Jakarta: "We are trying to find clues. Every organization has just arrived, but every group has indicated that they are very willing to cooperate."
Peter Sen reiterated that the main concern of the World Health Organization is to prevent the outbreak of epidemics such as cholera and dysentery, which may cause tens of thousands of deaths.
"We are very worried because many of us are homeless. They do not have enough clean water or proper food.
So the conditions for the outbreak of infectious diseases are already in place. "
However, Peter Sen stressed that so far there have been no signs of these diseases.
The Indonesian Ministry of Health said that in this tsunami, the number of people who died in Sumatra may reach as high as 100,000, and most of the victims were in Aceh.
Since most of the medical facilities in Aceh have been destroyed, the Indonesian military and Singapore and Australia have set up at least eight field hospitals in the past week. The United Nations Children's Fund has also started to send basic medical kits to help 200,000 children.
Powell predicts that Shiite will win in Iraqi general election
US Secretary of State Powell predicted today that the Shiite party will win in the upcoming Iraqi general election, but he also believes that due to the lack of harmony between the Shiite and Iranian Shiites in the past, it is unnecessary to worry that the Shiite victory may increase Iran's influence in Iraq.
There are increasing indications that Muslim Muslims may resist the January 30 elections, and may also be prohibited from participating in the general elections by the relevant Iraqi authorities as a result of the spread of the rebellion.
Powell said in the US National Broadcasting Company's "meeting with the Press" that "the new government and the Transitional National Assembly will be dominated by the Shiite majority.
The majority of the Iraqi population is also Shiite. "
Shiite Muslims account for more than 60 per cent of the Iraqi population, mostly in the south and in the central part of the country.
It is located in the central and western provinces, accounting for 20 per cent of the population.
The former foreign minister of the "Iraqi Independent Democratic Party", whose leader is the majority, today called for a postponement of the election. However, Powell said that the Iraqi election will be held as scheduled.
Powell also said that he felt that it was impossible for the Shiite government to control the future Iraqi government, which meant that Iran would manipulate the political situation in Iraq.
He said: "I now feel that even if Iran's influence is possible, Iran will of course try to influence the political situation in Iraq. However, there are great differences between Iran and Iraqi Shiite factions. There were also serious disputes and conflicts in the past."
International rescue has gradually impacted the victims of the tsunami for one wave after another.
Rescue troops from outside the country are now dropping food and establishing clean water supply systems in the affected areas of the Asian tsunami to help millions of homeless and famine victims.
According to statistics, the death toll has climbed to nearly 150,000.
There has been a steady flow of relief supplies from governments, and US President Bush has entrusted his father, the elder Bush and former President Clinton, with the responsibility of raising funds from the private sector.
As for the delegation led by US Secretary of State Powell, he arrived in Thailand last night to express the US concern and assess the progress of rescue efforts in advance of the crisis summit held in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, on the 6th.
Powell and his party include President Bush's brother, George W. Bush, governor of Florida, and the director of the International Development Department of the United States.
Powell will lead a delegation to inspect the disaster situation in Thailand, Indonesia and Sri Lanka before taking part in the 6th summit.
Powell said that the purpose of his visit was to assess the situation of the disaster and to observe what the United States still needs to do, but he would not immediately agree to increase more aid in addition to the $350 million pledged.
Since the outbreak of the disaster, many thousands of tourists, many of whom are foreign tourists, have been abandoned to look for their whereabouts.
However, Thai Prime Minister Dai Kissin pledged to continue his search in his country.
"Foreign experts told me," Foreign experts told me that they (missing persons) might be buried in the mud in the mangrove area, and we will continue to do our best to search for it, "he said.
The largest international relief operation has been carried out on a continuous basis.
The Navy helicopter dispatched by the US aircraft carrier "Lincoln" has carried out the second day of air drops of relief supplies and surviving survivors in Indonesia's Aceh province.
Lieutenant General Klaus, commander of the Navy, said that there are 50,000 pounds sterling of food and water transport to the affected areas, and the tasks are "smoothly carried out."
There is a hidden political struggle behind the campaign to aid the tsunami disaster.
On the occasion of the flow of supplies to the disaster areas of the Asian tsunami disaster, a relatively modest activity is being secretly carried out: governments are in the process of financing in that respect, on the one hand, and on the other hand, on the one hand, on the one hand, and on the other, on the other hand.
The catastrophe, which resulted in the death of nearly 150,000 people, has led to the resumption of the old war, including the United States, the United Nations and Europe, and the struggle for the dominant position in Asia.
However, the disaster relief experts still maintain a cautious hope that there are too many countries in this tsunami attack, and that the global nature of this disaster may lead to a precedent: the countries that are committed to providing assistance will indeed fulfil their commitments.
Zhu Ma, professor of international development at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said: "There has never been 100 per cent timely implementation of the aid commitments made by governments."
The amount of aid pledged by governments has reached as high as US $2 billion, including UN Secretary General Annan, US Secretary of State Powell and other leaders from Australia, China and Japan.
After being accused of being slow in response and an open attack by the United Nations relief services senior officials on the "miserly" of the wealthy countries, US President Bush increased the aid of the United States by nearly ten times, an increase of US $350 million.
In Asia, the tsunami disaster caused a hidden corner of regional influence. China, with growing confidence, pledged to provide US $60.5 million in aid, which is quite impressive for a developing country.
Japan, which has reduced its foreign aid budget for six years in a row, has quickly destroyed the saying that its national strength is declining. It has promised to offer at least US $500 million in aid, which has not been matched by all other countries.
Leaders of various countries in the world continue to visit Sri Lanka to inspect the disaster
Sri Lankan officials said that leaders from all over the world, including UN Secretary General Annan and US Secretary of State Powell, have arrived in Sri Lanka one after another to gain first-hand knowledge of the disaster caused by the seizure of 3600 lives in Sri Lanka at the end of last month.
They said that Powell has arrived here and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan will arrive later at noon.
According to a press release from the US embassy, Powell will visit some of the regions most seriously hit by the tsunami on December 26 of last year, including the United States Marine Corps stationed in the southern Caribbean region.
Meanwhile, the South Korean Embassy said that Lee Hae-chan, accompanied by the prime minister of Sri Lanka, will visit the western coast.
The statement said: "the prime minister of South Korea will visit the West Coast to observe the loss of life, life and property as a result of his visit to the west coast, accompanied by the prime minister of Sri Lanka.
Lee Hae-chan will stay in the most severely damaged herbalata to supervise the rescue operation carried out by South Korean civil society and non-governmental organizations.
UN Secretary General Annan is scheduled to arrive at night for a two-day visit.
"He will be accompanied by the president of the World Bank, Mr Warren Watson, in the southern and eastern regions," said a spokesman for the United Nations.
WHO Secretary General Lee Jong-wook will also arrive at the Colombo slope today.
German Foreign Minister Fischer is scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka on the weekend.
Sri Lankan officials said that several world leaders will come one after another in the next few weeks.
These leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Martin, announced yesterday that Martin will visit Sri Lanka and Thailand later this month.
Bush: US to strengthen peace efforts after Palestinian general election
US President Bush said today that the high turnout rate of the Palestinian general election today made him "deeply moved," and he promised that the United States would strengthen its peace efforts.
President Bush said in a statement: "The Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have taken a crucial step toward the establishment of a future democratic government through the election of the President of the new autonomous government.
The observers for the general elections described it as a free and fair election. "
He said: "This is a historic day for the Palestinian people and for the people of the Middle East."
Exit polls show that former Prime Minister Abbas won the general election by winning two thirds of the votes.
He will inherit Arafat as chairman of the Palestinian autonomous government.
Bush said: "These efforts, including today's presidential election and the parliamentary elections after a few months, are important for the establishment of a sovereign, independent, democratic and peaceful Palestinian state, which will ensure the security of Israel."
He said that the US government looks forward to working with the newly elected president of the Palestinian autonomous government and the Palestinian people to promote the great cause of peace in the Middle East.
Peace in the Middle East is in keeping with the aspirations of the peoples of Israel and Palestine to live in peace and security.
Bush also called on Israel to help improve the humanitarian and economic situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
He added that the Arab countries must "take concrete steps with all concerned to create a regional environment conducive to peace, give financial support to the Palestinian people and refuse to assist or shield terrorists".
Annan's visit to Sri Lanka's rebel control area obstructed
UN Secretary General Annan said today that he hoped that one day he would be able to return to Sri Lanka and "visit every part of the country."
It was reported that the government had prevented him from visiting the northern part of the country under the control of the rebels.
"I hope to be able to return to all regions of the country and help speed up the peace process."
Annan said he was personally opposed to his visit to the area under the control of the guerrillas because she feared that the rebels would use his visit as a political chip.
He said: "I have raised the question of the peace process and the need to strengthen the peace process.
I also discussed the matter with President Kouchner. "
Annan was unable to visit the areas under the control of the rebels, which provoked the anger of the inhabitants of the rebel municipality in the northern part of the country, and hundreds of people protested in front of the United Nations Office in Yaound.
However, the government of Sri Lanka categorically denied media reports, saying that the media had "misled" the matter.
On the other hand, at a time when people from all walks of life are making every effort to carry out relief work, the National Meteorological unit warned that the coastline of the country is likely to be hit by a typhoon, which is now being formed in the coastal waters.
Russian space agency denies rocket fuel causing children to become sick
The United Kingdom's weekly scientific journal "natural" reports that the high toxic rocket fuel fired by Russia during the launch of the space base in Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan, caused serious diseases among the children in the vicinity. However, the Russian space administration today denied such a claim.
The "natural" scientific journal published today quoted a study as saying that the standard of endocrine and blood diseases in the contaminated areas is twice as high as that of the General region.
The study was carried out by a group of Russian scientists, led by epidemiologists.
The Russian space agency responded, "the direct impact of space related activities on the health of the residents has not been confirmed."
This study, quoted by the Journal of natural science, focuses on children in the Republic of Altai.
The Republic of Altai is located in the mountainous areas on the edge of Siberia.
The Republic of Altai was selected as a research target due to the fact that it was contaminated by unburned fuel and, in particular, the mine.
Some of the Russian space launches were used as fuel for the previous phases.
During the period from 1998 to 2000, the health records of about 1,000 children in two contaminated areas were compared with 3,300 children's health records in the vicinity.
The natural science journal reported that during the quarter, the rate of medical care for children in the most polluted areas was almost twice as high as that of the pollution control unit, and the treatment time was twice as high.
White House says Iraq's election must have flaws
The White House admitted today that the Iraqi election scheduled for January 30 will not be perfect. At the same time, two car bomb attacks occurred today in Mosul, Iraq, killing at least two Iraqi soldiers.
"We all recognize that the election will not be perfect."
He said: "This is the first time that the Iraqi people have the freedom to choose their leaders. This is the election of a transitional government and one of the three elections this year."
"Therefore, we will try our best to assist the people of Iraq and the transitional government to ensure that the forthcoming elections will enable more people to participate as far as possible."
The bloody riots in Iraq on the 11th resulted in the death of at least 25 people, six of whom died in a car bomb attack in Tikrit, the hometown of former President Hussein. Under such circumstances, Allawi admitted that some areas in Iraq would not be able to participate in this month's elections.
Meanwhile, two car bomb attacks occurred today in Mosul, Iraq, causing the deaths of at least two Iraqi soldiers.
Sergeant of the US military sergeant snow Buddha told AFP that a truck exploded before attempting to attack the US-Iraq Joint military convoy, causing the death of an unknown number of people.
Snow Buddha said another car parked on the street exploded, killing two Iraqi soldiers.
US trade deficit reached 60 billion US dollars in November
According to statistics released today by the US Department of Commerce, the United States exports decreased by 2.3 percent in November last year and the trade deficit reached a record high of 60.3 billion US dollars.
The United States's exports fell to a new low of US $96.6 billion in the first five months of the year, and the volume of imports increased by more than US $2 billion to US $14.2 billion. As a result, the volume of imports grew by 1.3 percent to US $155.8 billion, setting a new record high.
The trade balance rose by 7.7 percent from US $56 billion in October last year to US $40 billion in November last year, an increase of 50.8% from US $40 billion in November of the previous year.
According to a survey conducted by the CBS market, Wall Street economists forecast that the trade deficit of goods and services will shrink to about US $53.3 billion.
Although the US dollar is weak, the products produced by the United States are cheaper at home and abroad, but the trade deficit of the United States is still expanding.
The report submitted by the Ministry of Commerce today will put pressure on the US dollar and once again call on Washington to play its role in the US energy independence and the resolution of the US-China trade imbalance.
The decline in the United States exports in November last year was due to a decrease of $1.4 billion in capital goods exports, including a decrease of 25 million US dollars in the export of aircraft and aircraft engines.
Exports of industrial materials decreased by $800 million, of which energy was the main source.
Exports of motor vehicles, consumer goods and food also declined.
Japanese Defense Agency chief: do not forget the history of the armed forces to respect the dignity of neighboring countries
Yoshinori Ono, Japan's Defense Agency chief, said today that when Japan takes a higher stance in the international arena, it will not forget the history of militarism and will bear in mind the "dignity" of the Asian neighboring countries.
When asked about the possibility of Japan sending its Self-Defense Forces to the tsunami disaster areas in South Asia, Yoshinori Ono said: "When we are in contact with Southeast Asian Nations, we should never forget the past."
He told reporters: "We must establish a relationship with our friends, so that we can tell our friends that we are in good faith.
When we look back at the past, we should fully respect the dignity of other countries. "
He said that this year marks the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war. He said: "We want to be reborn and cooperate for the new era."
He said he felt the "dignity" of an independent country at the end of March when the Indonesian leader told him that the rescue mission of Japan's Self-Defense Forces would end at the end of March.
The United Nations has expressed concern about the deadline imposed by the government of Indonesia on foreign forces.
Foreign forces have been well received because of their support and the most remote tsunami survivors.
Nearly 1,000 members of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces are on their way to the disaster of the tsunami on December 26. The number of victims of this natural disaster has exceeded 163,000.
This is the largest deployment operation of the Japanese Self-Defense forces since the end of the second world war.
The US-led Japanese post-war constitution stipulates that the self-defense forces cannot use force.
Political interference with the contents of the NHK program? Japanese media detonated controversy
It is said that the Japanese broadcasting company (NHK), which is said to have been under pressure from politicians, has shrunk its contents a few years ago when it broadcast a program related to the Japanese occupation of comfort women during World War II.
It is said that NHK, after discussions with high-level political figures, deleted most of the contents of this program. Most of the visits were for those who criticized the war in Japan and those who had been forced to act as comfort women.
However, the conservative newspapers defend the decision of the NHK to change the content of the program, believing that the senior management of the company has the responsibility to ensure that the content of the program is fair and objective.
This controversy broke out last week, and the key is a programme broadcast in 2001 on a mock trial for the war crimes committed by the Japanese army in wartime.
The trial was held in December 2000 by a feminist group in Tokyo. The verdict was finally handed down because of the Japanese occupation of comfort women during the Japanese occupation of Asian countries.
The historian said that at least 200,000 young women were forced to go to the front-line Japanese brothels in wartime. Most of them came from South Korea, but there were also some from Taiwan, China, the Philippines and Indonesia.
At a press conference on the 13th, the producer of this program, Wang Jingwang, revealed that prior to the broadcast of the program, the senior officials of the NHK had met with members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Shinzo Abe, and his party, and both of them expressed concern about the content of the program.
According to Chang Jing, the senior officials of NHK later reedited the programs and reduced their contents.
He said: "NHK bow to political pressure."
Abe and Zhongchuan admitted that they had met with NHK personnel and told them to be "fair." However, they firmly denied exerting pressure on the company.
Euro zone data show control of core inflation
Economists said today that the euro zone economic data released this week will show that core inflation is still under control.
At the same time, industrial production in the euro zone and consumer spending in France are expected to drop both.
When the European Union statistical office released inflation data on the 20th of this month, it is expected to confirm that the inflation rate will rise slightly from 2.2% in November to 2.3% in December.
However, the increase is largely due to an increase in the tobacco tax. The core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9%.
The figures for core inflation will be announced together with the consumer price figures.
Economists pointed out that the core inflation, excluding food, energy, tobacco and alcohol, has remained at between 1.6 and 2% over the past two years.
The chief executive of the European Central Bank, terutse, said on the 13th that short-term price pressure has recently been lowered.
Although inflation will remain at more than 2 per cent in the next few months, it may be lowered by the end of the year.
At the same time, another economist said that in view of the slowdown in Germany's growth, it is expected that industrial production in the euro zone will also be lowered in November.
German industrial production declined by 1.7 percent in November, while a survey of economists by AFP's financial news agency showed that the euro's industrial production will drop by 0.4 percent in November, after a 0.5 percent drop in October.
He said that industrial production in the euro zone is expected to rebound in December.
Red tape allows tsunami victims to suffer a second blow.
Three weeks after the most violent tsunami hit, the survivors of the disaster are now confronting the bad practices of bureaucracy and politics. At the same time, the global focus has shifted to other places.
Thousands of rotten bodies were dug out from the rubble, bringing the number of victims of the tsunami disaster on December 26 to more than 168,000. At the same time, the upcoming Iraqi general election and the inauguration ceremony of President Bush replaced the tsunami disaster, becoming the top news item in the global media.
Indonesia originally requested foreign troops participating in humanitarian rescue missions to withdraw within three months, but subsequently withdrew the request.
In Thailand, the leaders of Canada, Sweden, Norway and Finland are meeting to discuss the reconstruction plan and the identification of remains.
However, the survivors are facing new difficulties, such as the deep-rooted bureaucratic style of Indonesia, which has impeded the flow of relief supplies from all over the world.
In a small village near Aceh, the capital of Indonesia's Aceh province, fisherman bustdi said: "We are like people who do not exist at all. The tsunami has caused us huge losses. We lose everything and face hunger."
He said: "We saw on television the food, clothing and other relief supplies that poured into Aceh."
Like the thousands of other victims, they lost their identity cards and other official documents because of the tsunami, thus making his efforts to receive relief supplies a nightmare.
Although he pleaded with the officials to go through the formalities every day, the results were the same: they did not receive relief supplies.
It's said that Zeng Qinghong went to visit Zhao Ziyang when he was dying.
The China Human Rights Movement Information Center in Hong Kong said that before the ousted Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang passed away this morning, Chinese State Vice President Zeng Qinghong went to the hospital to visit him.
The information center said that according to Zhao Ziyang's family, Zeng Qinghong visited him at the Beijing Hospital at 6 o'clock this morning. He died about an hour later at the age of 85.
Zhao Ziyang once served as the general secretary and Prime Minister of the Communist Party of China. In 1989, he was removed from office because of his opposition to the use of force to suppress the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square. He was then placed under house arrest and has been regarded as an unpopular figure by the government.
The information center said that according to Zhao's family, current Premier Wen Jiabao, who had worked at Zhao Ziyang, did not go to visit him when he was critically ill.
However, before Zhao Ziyang fell into a coma on the 14th, Tian Jiyun, a retired central committee member who had served as his assistant, went to see him.
The information center of the human rights movement in China has been in contact with Zhao's family, and has, over the years, issued correct information on the situation of Zhao Ziyang in due course.
The information center said that some 20 retired Party and government officials are prepared to issue an open letter to the Chinese Communists, calling for a reassessment of the contributions of Zhao Ziyang and calling for a public memorial service for him.
The center also said that Zhao Ziyang's family would not be allowed to hold or prepare a funeral, and that the relevant arrangements would have to be decided by the party.
The wife of Zhao Ziyang's wife, Mr Leung pak-chi, is 86 years old.
The information center said that because of her poor health, she had not been informed that her husband had passed away this evening.
Zhao Ziyang passed away from all sides to promote democratization in China
When the former leader of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhao Ziyang, passed away today, people from all over the world praised him, and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, the Taiwan government and overseas Chinese democratic movement figures all called for Beijing to implement the concept of the Democratic Reform of Zhao Ziyang.
In 1989, as a result of his opposition to the military suppression of the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square, Zhao Ziyang spent the rest of his life under house arrest. He died at a hospital in Beijing this morning at the age of 85.
According to a press report, Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi, in memory of Zhao Ziyang, said: "I hope that they (China) will strive for democratization."
Taiwan also called on China to implement democratic and political reforms after the death of Zhao Ziyang.
In order to oppose the bloody suppression of the Tiananmen pro-democracy movement, the people of China's democratic movement abroad have praised Zhao Ziyang as "one of the greatest reforms in China," and has sacrificed his political life in order to oppose the bloody suppression of the Tiananmen pro-democracy movement.
The chairman of the New York freedom China movement, who was once the leader of the student movement, said: "During the 15 years of his house arrest, he openly advocated the need for political reform in the direction of the rule of law and democracy.
Zhao Ziyang will be remembered by later generations as a truly democratic and principled person. "
Some pro-democracy figures asked the Chinese government to hold a public funeral for Zhao Ziyang and to make a fair evaluation of his achievements.
However, they admitted that Zhao Ziyang was unlikely to receive such a courtesy because the Chinese government was worried that the people who were dissatisfied with the communist rule would take advantage of this opportunity to create turmoil.
The student movement in 1989 was triggered by the death of the reformist leader, Hu Yaobang.
The Xinhua News Agency today issued a brief report saying that the death of Comrade Zhao Ziyang in Beijing was the only official statement on the matter.
United Nations: rich countries fail to meet poverty reduction commitments
In a new report, the panel of experts appointed by the United Nations stated that it promised to provide financial assistance with a view to halving the world's extremely poor population by the year 2015.
The rich countries of the world have promised to participate in the ambitious "millennium development goals" plan of the United Nations in order to improve the fate of the world's poor and suffering populations.
However, at present, more than one billion people live on less than one dollar a day, and 2.7 billion people live on less than US $2 a day. United Nations experts say that the time for the rich countries to fulfill their commitments is hardly enough.
The United Nations Development Program Director Brown said: "with the correct mobilization of resources and political will, the reform of the developing countries and the developed countries can still be achieved."
United Nations experts said that 22 rich countries in the world have pledged to provide 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product assistance to developing countries, but they are currently providing 0.25 per cent.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has commissioned development experts led by the former Harvard economist Sharon to compile the progress report, which includes the eradication of extreme poverty, universal primary education, the reduction of child mortality, and the fight against AIDS and other deadly diseases.
The report says: "The real solution is already in place, the political structure has been set up, and the cost is for the first time.
UN announces establishment of global disaster warning system
The United Nations announced that a global disaster warning system would be established to prevent major natural disasters.
However, after the tragedy of the great tsunami in South Asia, the technology of this disaster warning system is still controversial in that country.
Following a global conference in Kobe, Japan, a number of United Nations organizations issued a joint statement indicating that United Nations experts would establish a global disaster warning system to reduce the damage caused by major natural disasters.
The major disaster caused by the massive tsunami in South Asia has caused great indignation among the countries of the Indian Ocean.
He said: "The new plan will bring peace and security to mankind.
An effective early warning system will guarantee the lives and safety of millions of people around the globe. "
But this statement of the United Nations is largely symbolic.
UNESCO officials said that more important consultations will be held on this disaster warning system.
UNESCO is taking the lead in promoting the establishment of a global disaster warning system.
The head of the Intergovernmental Panel on ocean affairs of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) said: "At present, several countries have proposed different plans, so we need to work in coordination and cooperation."
He said that the committee will hold two meetings within 60 days, and it is hoped that the two meetings will decide on the use of the tsunami warning system proposed by that country.
One of the meetings was held in Paris, and the venue of another meeting had not yet been decided.
It is hoped that a decision will be reached in July and the global disaster warning system will be completed by the middle of 2006. This is also the target date set by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
The number of people infected with HIV in Beijing has increased by 40%.
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) A total of 2,046 cases of HIV infection were reported in Beijing from 1985 to October 2004, according to the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau.
According to National AIDS statistics, the number of reports on people infected with HIV in Beijing is 8th in the country.
Of the 2,046 cases of people infected with HIV, 403 were from Beijing, 1507 were in the field, 106 were foreign personnel, and there were no more than 30 of them.
According to analysis, the HIV infection in Beijing is dominated by intravenous drug abuse and sexual transmission. The infection of people with HIV infection is mainly through intravenous drug abuse and blood consumption; and the HIV infection among foreigners is dominated by sexually transmitted diseases.
In order to prevent the further spread of AIDS, beginning in July 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the 18 districts and counties of Beijing municipality set up AIDS free consultation rooms and antibody screening laboratories to conduct face-to-face consultations, blood preliminary examinations, and epidemiological surveys, and will be gradually extended to hospitals at level 2 and above in the city.
The Beijing Municipal Department of Health has designated Gean hospital and the Union hospital as the clinical part of the AIDS free treatment center in Beijing. The pharmaceutical products required by the Beijing Municipal Department of Health and the municipal financial bureau have been centralized under the unified organization of the Beijing Municipal Health Department and the City Financial Bureau.
The Beijing Education Commission has studied and formulated a policy of free education for people infected with HIV and children, as well as the education policy for HIV carriers among young students.
At present, hospitals with obstetrics and obstetrics at level 2 of the city are provided with free AIDS counselling, screening, and hospitals and Union hospitals for pregnant women.
At present, a safety package of 1,390 machines is installed free of charge in the ministry's division; methadone maintenance is carried out among injecting drug users and pilot sites have been set up.
Production capacity of Shanghai's power generating equipment ranks first in the world
SHANGHAI, December 1 (Xinhua) an annual production target of 15 million kilowatts was completed by the Shanghai Electric Power Station, the first of its kind in the world.
Shanghai Electrical Power Station is the largest power plant manufacturing base in China.
In recent years, due to the rapid increase in demand for power generation facilities in China, the National generator manufacturers have entered a period of high growth and development.
At the same time, the power station of the Shanghai Electrical Power Station combined the power resources of power stations such as turbine and power station boilers, and subsequently obtained the production orders of nine heavy gas generating units and three more hot boilers in the form of an overall tender.
At the same time, the efficiency of enterprise management, technology development and production has been further enhanced through integration.
At present, Shanghai Electrical Power Station has occupied 40 percent of the market share of the equipment industry in China, and has continued to expand overseas markets in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and South America.
This year alone, as a mainframe unit for generating equipment, Shanghai Auto Engineering Company received a sales order of 6 billion yuan.
Zheng Jianhua, president of the Shanghai Electrical Power Station Group, said that this summer's "electricity shortage" has increased the demand for power stations in various parts of the country, and the competition in the production of power station equipment has intensified.
The group is in the process of implementing the three major goals of "research and development of power generation units of millions of kw power, gas generation units and millions of kw nuclear power plants," with a view to achieving the goal of becoming one of the world's top 500 people at an early date.
(Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan) Hong Kong Observatory provides new services to World Meteorological Organization website
Hong Kong, December 2 (Xinhua) The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has started to provide two new services to the World Weather Information Service (WMO).
A spokesman for the observatory said the two new services included the inclusion of global official weather observations on clouds and rainfall in the "World Weather Information Service" web site.
These two services are another new service provided by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) following the "bad weather information centre" at the beginning of the year.
It is understood that the "World Weather Information Service" website has always provided official weather forecasts and urban monthly Weather information for major cities in the world.
For the first time, the new service provides global official weather observations and is the first to launch the project with a global map of cloud amount and rainfall.
The new homepage covers a wide range of areas with high density, and is updated on a regular basis eight times a day.
The new product of the "bad weather information center" website is a review function for the provision of tropical cyclone mobile routes.
The previous design was that the Web site would no longer store information such as the earlier position of the tropical cyclone when the tropical cyclone dissipated.
However, a few days after the landing of the tropical cyclone, there is a tendency for the public to have access to relevant information on the tropical cyclone.
To this end, new products have stored tropical cyclone levels, positions and mobile trails for the past seven days, allowing the public and the media to obtain the required information for a few days after the tropical cyclone has landed and dispersed.
The world's first rapid diagnosis of the H5N1 avian flu virus has been successfully developed in Shantou.
Shantou, December 3 (Xinhua) over half a year of cooperation between the University of Shantou and the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong has developed the world's first batch of rapid diagnostic kits for the avian flu virus.
At the earliest, we can arrive at the conclusion that they are infected with the bird flu virus within an hour at the earliest.
According to Professor Guan Xi, director of the joint influenza research center at Shantou University and the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong, according to the information currently available, the mortality rate of avian flu, which is classified as a highly toxic virus, is far higher than that of the SARS virus.
In the past, the virus was from "suspected" to three to five days, but it would take more than a week.
The rapid detection technology of the avian flu virus, which has been successfully introduced this time, is able to detect the conclusion that the bird flu virus can be found within an hour and at the latest within two hours.
The new technology is simple, convenient and fast, and can be tested in the epidemic areas. The accuracy rate is more than 90 percent. This helps to prevent the early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment of the virus, and prevent large-scale spread of the virus.
Commissioned by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the joint influenza research center of Shantou University and the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong recently held a training course on bird flu virus detection technology, training participants from 20 provincial and municipal disease prevention and control centers throughout the country, including the latest rapid detection technology of the avian flu virus.
A spokesman for the office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed strong dissatisfaction with the chairman of the US House of Representatives committee on international relations.
Hong Kong, December 3 (Xinhua) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong said today that he was strongly dissatisfied with the speech delivered by the chairman of the International Relations Committee of the US House of Representatives in Hong Kong a few days ago.
The spokesman said that the speech delivered by Mr. Haide, chairman of the House International Relations Committee of the US House of Representatives in Hong Kong, carried out a malicious attack on China's development and progress. We express our strong dissatisfaction with the cold war mentality of slandering China's foreign policy.
The spokesman said: The people of the world know that China's development is not only in line with the fundamental interests of the 1.3 billion Chinese people, but is also conducive to world prosperity and development.
On the international political stage, China is a responsible country and has played a positive and constructive role in safeguarding world peace and stability.
On the issue of nuclear non-proliferation, China has always strictly complied with the relevant international conventions, resolutely opposed any form of nuclear proliferation, and advocated resolving such problems through consultation, dialogue and the strengthening of international supervision.
The spokesman pointed out that it is regrettable that Mr. Hai has ignored the objective facts and made these extremely irresponsible remarks at a time when Sino-US relations have further developed toward a healthy and stable development. This is not in line with the consensus reached by the Chinese and US heads of state on the development of bilateral relations, which is undoubtedly harmful to the development of Sino-US relations.
China's largest water desalination project settled in boat Mountain
HANGZHOU, December 6 (Xinhua) The water desalination project, with a capacity of up to 10,000 tons, will be settled in Zhejiang Province in Zhejiang Province, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.
To the residents of boat Mountain, who have suffered a lot from water shortage, the sea water, which has been close to them for hundreds of years, will soon become clear and sweet water flows to millions of households.
SOURCE: Central Meteorological Station, China.
With an investment of 50 million yuan and 10,000 tons of fresh water, it is currently the largest desalination project in the mainland. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed next year.
Guangzhou City is one of the cities with a relatively serious water shortage in China.
There are 1,390 large and small islands in the city, with an average of 601 cubic meters per capita, and only 25.4 percent of Zhejiang's per capita Holdings, and the draught problem has plagued the lives of the urban residents of the island.
For example, every day, 1,500 tons of fresh water have to be shipped from a town nearby, with a cost of more than 10 yuan per ton.
The anti-infiltration water desalination technology, developed by the Hangzhou Water Treatment Technology Development Center of the State Oceanic Administration, is a process that is driven by pressure as a driving force, and is the hot spot in the current international water desalination research field.
The official in charge of the center said that through technological improvements and the domestic transformation of equipment, the cost of anti-infiltration water desalination projects and energy consumption have already been reduced.
The cost per ton of water desalination has fallen further on the basis of $5.
This indicates that the cost of desalination is expected to be close to water supply and the price of industrial water.
(international) the results of the referendum held in Hungary on the 5th
Budapest, December 5 (Xinhua) Hungary today held a referendum on the privatization of public health care institutions and the dual nationality of the Hungarian people.
The result of the referendum was invalid because the number of voters who participated in the voting, as well as the number of those who voted in favour of or against the two issues, did not meet the legal requirements.
The national electoral office of Hungary conducted a survey of 99.91% of the votes in the late night of the 5th, showing that 301,000 people took part in the voting, accounting for 37.48 percent of the total number of voters in the country.
Of these, 191.09 million and 103.30 million respectively voted in favour of and against the first issue, accounting for 23.87 per cent and 12.85 per cent of the national electorate; 151.201 and 146,000 respectively voted in favour of and against the second issue, representing 18.88 per cent and 17.75 per cent of the national electorate.
According to the relevant laws of Hungary, only 50 per cent of the total number of voters in the country, or more than 25 per cent of the total number of voters in the country, will be able to vote.
Earlier, the Hungarian government and the ruling party had always called on voters to vote against the above two questions, while the opposition party appealed to the voters to vote in favour.
According to reports, the referendum was the lowest in all the referendum and elections.
After the announcement of the results of the election, Hungarian Prime Minister giorani gave a speech recognizing the failure of the referendum.
He said that the government would be more active in formulating national policies and carrying out medical and health reforms.
Ban Ki-moon, Chairman of the largest opposition party in Hungary, said that although the number of people casting an affirmative vote did not reach the stipulated ratio, the referendum was beneficial.
He called on the government and Congress to consider the results of the referendum when formulating the relevant laws.

Construction of underground power stations on Three Gorges Project
Wuhan, December 8 (Xinhua) the construction of the main power station of the Three Gorges Project was opened for the first time on December 8.
The Three Gorges project design is designed to install 26 700,000 kilowatts of power generation units with an installed capacity of 18.2 million kilowatts, with an average power generation of 84.7 billion kwh after the commissioning of the Three Gorges project.
In order to further tap the power potential of the Three Gorges Project, the Three Gorges project has set aside the location of an underground power station in its initial design.
According to a briefing given by the head of the Three Gorges Project Development Corporation of China's Yangtze River, the main building of the Three Gorges dam is located on the right side of the Three Gorges Dam.
Six 700,000 kilowatts will be installed at the underground power station.
As a result, the total installed capacity of the Three Gorges project will be increased from 26 to 32. The installed capacity will increase from 18.2 million kilowatts to 22.4 million kilowatts, thus greatly increasing the power generation capacity of the Three Gorges project.
Flood prevention is the primary task for the construction of the Three Gorges project.
According to the movement control plan for the Three Gorges Reservoir, the water level in the Three Gorges reservoir will be reduced from a normal water level of 175 meters to a limit of 145 meters.
Therefore, the construction of the underground power station will increase the water supply target for the Three Gorges reservoir, reduce the number of abandoned water and increase the amount of electricity generated so as to maximize the peak hours of the power station.
At present, preliminary work has begun on the construction of the construction of the Three Gorges underground power station.
It is understood that the underground power station will be completed and put into operation by the end of 2008.

A coup d'閠at took place in c魌e d'Ivoire in September 2002 and a civil war broke out.
In January of last year and in July of this year, the major political parties and the opposition armed representatives reached an agreement in France and Ghana and agreed to restore peace and achieve national reconciliation.
However, the process of implementing the agreement was full of twists and turns, which led to repeated setbacks in the peace process.
The opposition forces in the northern part of the control section announced the recall of their representatives in politics in mid-October, and the peace process in the section has once again reached an impasse.
In the early part of November, after serious clashes between government troops and French KFOR troops, the situation in the section deteriorated further.

Experts advocate setting up of an adult News spokesperson system in China
SHANGHAI, December 13 (Xinhua) China should set up a News spokesperson system on the situation of minors on a regular basis.
According to a recent survey conducted by the relevant authorities in Shanghai, there is an average of 1.17 hours a day for a minor to read about 1.05 hours on television. About half of the time spent by the media comes from the media, and the media is using a completely new social force to become a factor affecting the growth and development of minors.
"The media is a window linking the mind of the minors with the outside world. When the windows are opened, the fresh air comes in and the flies are also coming in."
Chen Jian, chairman of the board of directors of Shanghai Grand Network Development Company Ltd., said.
While the media have created favorable conditions for the healthy growth of minors, because of the market competition and the need for economic benefits, and the poor quality of some journalists, the views expressed in the articles are easy to mislead young people's thinking and values, and some media even spread the content of violence and pornography.
At present, China has more than 2,000 television channels, more than 1,500 broadcasting frequencies, and 1,868 radio programmes. The number of Internet users in China is as high as 87 million.
Relevant leaders of the forum said that the establishment of a News spokesperson system for minors can provide authoritative investigation materials on the current situation and problems of youth development, change the current situation of the media's "indiscriminate voice" and provide a healthy and favorable public opinion environment for the growth of minors.
(international) Iraqi foreign minister believes Iraq's general election faces three major issues
Dubai, December 14 (Xinhua) Iraqi interim government Foreign Minister Zebari said here today that Iraq will face three major problems, namely, the deterioration of the security situation and interference in the election process.
In his speech at the "Arab Strategy Forum" held in Dubai, Zebari said that it is very necessary for Iraq to hold general elections as scheduled, because the general election will not only determine the new Iraqi leader, but will also determine that Iraq is a free, democratic and unified country that belongs to all Iraqis.
He expressed his belief that the future Iraqi government will be a legitimate government that represents the Iraqi people and expresses its wishes.
Zebari said that the US-led coalition forces should exist in Iraq at the request of Iraq and provide protection to Iraq because the current Iraqi interim government is unable to control the security situation and cannot catch up with terrorists and sabotage elements.
There is time for the coalition forces to exist, and it will end with the completion of the political process and the emergence of a legitimate government in Iraq in accordance with United Nations resolutions.
He stressed that the new Iraq will continue to maintain Arab and Islamic attributes and abide by the Charter of the League of Arab States.
The Iraqi people are facing the historic opportunity to rebuild their country on a new basis, and Iraq will rise again and become an important member of the Arab family that can contribute to the nation.
Belgian joint asset management company to be stationed in Shanghai
SHANGHAI, December 15 (Xinhua) The joint asset management company of Belgium announced Friday that it will be stationed in Shanghai.
The company said on the same day that it was actively seeking China's cooperation partners in an effort to bring the joint venture fund companies into operation in early 2006.
The president of the joint asset management company of Belgium, Mr Clement Du, said that as an important step in gaining access to China's asset management market, the company has obtained permission from China's securities regulatory authority to officially open a representative office in Shanghai.
According to the development strategy of the Chinese market, the company will first open up the retail market.
He also said that the capital preservation fund is the most powerful product of the company's fund, and it will continue to be the foundation of the world's top financial institutions.
The joint asset management company of Belgium, with 50 years of asset management experience, provides asset management services for institutional customers, corporate customers and individual investors, and manages a series of investment instruments for them.
The company manages a wide range of fund products.
As of June this year, the total assets of the capital preservation fund administered by it amounted to US $28 billion.
In the past decade, more than 550 capital preservation funds have been issued, involving more than 350 different product structures.
"We welcome the recent decision of the relevant Chinese regulatory authorities to allow commercial banks to set up their own holdings," he said.
"We are actively looking for a local partner to establish a joint venture fund," he said.
He said that there is still plenty of room for the Chinese market.
The Belgian joint asset management company, based in Brussels, has 45 per cent of its shares under the control of the Belgian joint bank.

(international) UN warns that the number of people who died of drug abuse will increase in 2005.
VIENNA, December 17 (Xinhua) The United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, the executive director of the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, warned against the increase in heroin production in Afghanistan in 2005.
Costa Rica has issued a warning to health and anti-drug agency officials in Europe and neighbouring countries, calling on these countries to pay attention to the latest trends in drug cultivation and international drug crime in Afghanistan and to take appropriate preventive measures.
According to statistics provided by the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, based in Vienna, heroin production in Afghanistan fell by 94 per cent when the opium industry in Afghanistan was banned in 2001, and in the second year the purity of heroin in Europe fell by 50 per cent.
Between 2000 and 2002, the number of drug abusers in Europe decreased by 20 per cent.
Costa Rica said that, compared with 2003, the area of opium cultivation in Afghanistan has increased by 64 percent, and heroin production has reached over 500 tons, higher than that of the global heroin black market. This trend means an increase in the global drug purity and the corresponding increase in the number of drug addicts.
Costa Rica believes that the drug source in Afghanistan has already posed a "clear and real threat" to the global anti-drug effort, and that the increase in the supply of illegal heroin means "death sentences" against drug addicts.
It is estimated that the number of deaths due to excessive drug abuse in the world is approximately 100,000 per year.
(international) US military has also confirmed that one Guantanamo prisoner is not an enemy combatant.
WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) A US military review team has confirmed that one of the prisoners held at the US naval base at Guantanamo is not an enemy combatant and will soon be released.
This is the second Guantanamo prisoner recognized by the US military as not an enemy combatant.
England said that the Pentagon confirmed the identity of the prisoner one or two days ago. The State Council will inform the prisoners' countries of the decision and arrange for the release of the prisoner.
However, he did not disclose the name and nationality of the prisoner or the circumstances under which he was caught.
England refused to acknowledge that the Ministry of Defense had made a mistake in determining the identity of the prisoners at Guantanamo.
He said that the military review team responsible for reviewing the status of prisoners at Guantanamo had conducted a review of 507 prisoners and confirmed the identity of 230 persons, of whom 228 were in the right position.
To date, the United States has released some 200 Guantanamo prisoners, some of whom have been released after their repatriation, while a few remain in detention after their return, but at least 12 have been released after being released.
The United States naval base at Guantanamo is currently holding about 550 al-Qa'idah and Taliban suspects, most of whom were captured during the United States war against Afghanistan.
The United States government claims that these persons are enemy combatants, not prisoners of war, and are therefore not protected by the Geneva Conventions.
Many countries have criticized the United States government for the indefinite detention of their citizens, and some international organizations have criticized this practice of the United States government as a violation of international law.
Top national domain name nodes settle in Shanghai
SHANGHAI, December 21 (Xinhua) China's Internet Information Center and Shanghai Information Industry (Holdings) Ltd. settled in Shanghai on 21 December.
Domain names are the telecommunications base for all Internet applications such as e-commerce and e-government, and are now widely used as Internet addresses.
People who visit websites and send and receive e-mail are required to import their domain names first. Through the analysis service of the domain name system, they will convert their domain names to IP addresses and find the Internet hosts to achieve the transmission of information.
The domain name system is like the "nervous system", which controls the transmission of information on the Internet.
Mao Wei, director of the China Internet Information Center, which manages the top domain name system in China, said that as of now, China has more than 90 million netizens and the number of Internet users is the second highest in the world; the number of websites has exceeded 650,000.
The resolution of domain names is directly proportional to the use of the Internet. With the rapid development of the Internet, the resolution of domain names has also increased rapidly.
At present, the number of CNPS is growing at a rate of 10,000 a month, reaching 430 000.
The national top domain name server, which is run by the China Internet Information Center, handles over 380 million domain name analysis requests each day, with an average of more than 4,400 trips per second and a peak of more than 8,000.
In the face of the rapid development trend of the Internet, the China Internet Information Center of China's domain name registration administration has carried out a reassessment of the four original national domain name nodes in the country this year, and has redeployed to the top of the country's domain name nodes on the basis of assessment.
According to the local Internet development level and the hardware and software conditions of the connection units, it is determined that the national domain name nodes will settle in Shanghai.
According to reports, Shanghai has 4.5 million domain names, with a total of 26.6 percent of Internet users, and the Internet penetration rate and application level are the highest in the country.
In the East China region around Shanghai, there are 130,000 Internet domain names and 230,000 websites. The level of development is also in the forefront.
To this end, Shanghai was selected as the first node of the redeployment plan.
China becomes the world's largest producer of rigid alloys
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) China has become the largest producing country in the world in terms of production scale and production.
This was reported by reporters on the 22nd at a seminar on the development strategy of Ganzhou, China, which is being held in China.
The rigid alloys are known as "industrial teeth" because of their high degree of stiffness and endurance as cutting tools, high pressure tools and mining and road construction machinery, and the development of the rigid alloy industry plays a very important role in the development of the entire industry.
It is reported that China's rigid alloys started from the 50's of the 20th century, and there has been constant development. So far, remarkable achievements have been made.
In the early 80's of the 20th century, the annual production of rigid alloys in the world was about 5,000 tons. In the 21st century, the annual production of rigid alloys in the world reached 80,000 tons, while the production of rigid alloys in China has increased rapidly to 15,000 tons, more than one third of the world's rigid alloys.
There has also been significant progress in the export of rigid alloys in China.
In 1986, the annual export volume of China's rigid alloy was only 100 tons; by 2003, the volume of exports has reached 2,500 tons; this year it is expected to export more than 3,000 tons, which is as much as $4 million a year.
ADB loans to support Shanxi's use of coal and coal to generate electricity
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) The Asian Development Bank (ADB) today approved a loan of 1.174 billion U S dollars to support the construction of a power plant in southern Shanxi Province.
The coal level development demonstration project will make use of the latest technology to increase the production of coal and coal, and to provide fuel to a power plant that is about to be built.
Under the project plan, the project, when completed in 2008, will provide at least 166 million cubic metres of coal gas per year to some 90,000 households and industrial and commercial users.
About 410,000 people in the city of Jincheng will benefit.
Shanxi's coal production accounts for about one third of the country's total.
The total cost of the project is estimated at $237 million, of which the Japan International Cooperation Bank will provide US $20 million in loans and the China Construction Bank will provide US $3.86 million in loans.
The city government and the two mining / industrial groups in the region will provide a total of $612.4 million in stock.
The United States trade development agency has also provided US $500,000 in grants for the project.
From the surface to the underground coal layer, the methane obtained from the construction of the mine was referred to as a coal layer, and the methane generated in underground coal mining operations was referred to as a coal mine.
Methane is a highly volatile gas which needs to be discharged first in coal mining operations in order to ensure the safety of the working environment.
The removal, collection and use of methane will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to global warming and climate change.
The greenhouse effect of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide.
The use of methane as a substitute for coal will also increase the use of clean fuels, improve the efficiency of coal mines and make the air cleaner.
The ADB senior project expert, harson, said that the project is expected to provide about 4.5 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions.
(international) the treasures of the Museum of the Israeli museum
JERUSALEM, December 24 (Xinhua) The head of the Israeli museum, James stonde, said today that the treasures of the museum have been confirmed to be counterfeit.
It was once considered to be the only relic of the First Temple of the Solomon Islands that has been discovered so far.
In a statement, Snyder said that the authorities had carried out a detailed assessment of the pomegranate, which was the size of the thumb.
The expert found that it should be a relic of the bronze period, the age of which was far earlier than the first temple of the Jewish people.
The Hebrew words of the pomegranate show: "It belongs to the Temple of God, the sacred objects of God."
And these handwriting tests were carried out later.
In the 80's of the last century, the Israeli museum spent US $550,000 from an anonymous collector.
According to the experts of the archaeological and cultural heritage, it is the treasure of the First Temple. It is also the only cultural relic to be left behind at that time.
Snyder said that prior to the purchase of the ivory pomegranate, an expert from Israel's archaeologists, Mr. Neman, and other experts, confirmed that it was true.
According to a report by the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz, alviged only used a magnifying glass to make a rough appraisal of the cultural relics.
This kind of argument has been rejected by his own name.
In recent months, the Israeli police have identified three consecutive cases of large-scale cultural relics, and several hundred people have been summoned.
In the course of the investigation, the police and the Hong Kong Cultural Heritage Board found that the ivory had been found to be counterfeit.
Police will initiate legal proceedings against some of the people involved in the case next week.
In the tenth century B.C., the king of the Jewish King built the first temple on the Temple Mount on the Temple Mount, where sacred objects, such as the cabinet and the boat, were deposited, and the holy objects were later destroyed.
Shenzhen to enforce application of "medium water" in some buildings and communities
GUANGZHOU, December 26 (Xinhua) Shenzhen will enforce the application of "China Water" in a number of larger buildings and communities, and the relevant regulations and regulations are in the process of being formulated.
"Water" refers mainly to the fact that urban sewage or sewage treatment has reached a certain level of water quality and can be used in a certain range of non-potable water.
The water is between tap water and sewage discharged into the pipeline.
In general, extensive use has been made of flushing, garden and farmland irrigation, road maintenance, car washing, urban sprays, cooling equipment and water supply.
According to a survey conducted by the Shenzhen Water Authority, in the mid 90's of the 20th century, Shenzhen City had a system of "medium water" recovery facilities. However, due to factors such as technology, design, and management, the cost of recycling was too high, and construction units had no choice but to give up their use.
If these pipes are to be truly effective, they will only need to spend $300,000 to $400,000 to install the "central water" treatment system.
If we use the more than 70 "China Water" pipes now in use, using 500 tons of "medium water" per day in each district, we can save 35,000 tons of tap water for Shenzhen in one day.
According to the briefing, the recovery work of the "China Water" in Shenzhen will begin with the transformation of more than 70 buildings with the "China Water" recovery system. After summing up the experience, it will be further promoted.
At the same time, the water department in Shenzhen will work with the city planning, construction, and other departments as soon as possible to formulate the "China Water" design standards as soon as possible. It also stipulates that the application of "water in China" should be imposed on some of the larger buildings.
After processing, the "China Water" will be the first to be used in urban greening.

BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) today decided to strengthen supervision over the management of financial assets.
A responsible official of the CBRC said on the 29th that the CBRC will investigate and deal with irregularities in the management and disposal of bad assets in accordance with the law, and those involved in criminal offences will be referred to the judicial authorities for criminal responsibility.
The results of handling major typical cases should be disclosed to the public in the form of public exposure, and they should be monitored by the society.
In the near future, the CBRC will focus on improving and strengthening the regulatory mechanism for financial asset management companies in four areas:

It is necessary to formulate a unified plan for the construction of a financial asset management company, and solve the problem of the current imperfect regulations of the financial assets management company.
The CBRC will draft as soon as possible the "Guidelines for the management of bad assets of financial assets management companies", "information disclosure method for financial asset management companies" and "penalties for violation of laws by financial asset management companies."
Second, it is necessary to improve the corporate governance mechanism of financial asset management companies, and solve the problems of short-term and moral risks in the operation of financial asset management companies in terms of system, mechanism, and management.

SHANGHAI, December 30 (Xinhua) Hong Kong and Macao residents applied for the establishment of private enterprises in Shanghai on January 1, 2005.
This reporter learned from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Commerce and Industry that the procedure for Hong Kong and Macao residents applying for the establishment of private enterprises in Shanghai is not complicated. The materials that need to be submitted include the application for registration of individual industrial and commercial enterprises (Hong Kong and Macao residents), the applicant's identity documents, and other documents required by the national laws and regulations.
Starting from January 1, 2005, Shanghai's Industry and Commerce Department will set up special windows and "green corridors" in 20 branch offices throughout the city to provide applications, receive, and approve one-stop services for Hong Kong and Macao residents.
In addition, the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Department has also set up a "Hong Kong and Macao residents' registration form for private enterprises in the mainland" at the official website (www.ss.gov.n). The applicant can download it directly.
The applicant can also obtain information from the Internet at any time to find out the relevant information. The Shanghai industrial and commercial website will give a reply within two working days on the issue of the registration of Hong Kong and Macao residents in Shanghai.

(international) assets of Yugansk, which was auctioned off, will not be included in Gazprom.
MOSCOW, December 30 (Xinhua) The Russian oil company, the largest subsidiary of the Russian oil company, will not be included in the assets of Gazprom.
According to other reports, Russian Minister of Industry and Energy Khristenko said on the same day that the assets of Yugansk, which was auctioned off, will not be included in the assets of Gazprom. The main reason for this is that the state is already the main shareholder of Gazprom, and the state does not wish to increase its share beyond its control.
He said that the assets of Yugansk would be left separately and handed over to a company owned by the entire country.
On the 19th of this month, the Russian Federation Property Foundation held a public auction of the 76.79% stake in Yugansk, the largest subsidiary of Yukos oil company. The newly formed Baikal financial group won the bid with a price of 93.5 billion US dollars.
On the 22nd, the state-owned Russian oil company also announced that Baikal financial group, which filmed Yugansk, had become the new holder of Yugansk.
Analysts believe that an important reason for Russia's skilful operation of Yugansk's assets is to take the lead in related legal disputes.
In September this year, Russian President Putin approved the merger of Gazprom by Gazprom.
Gazprom was established in February 1993 and is the world's largest natural gas mining company.
The gas reserves held by the company account for 65% of Russia's natural gas reserves.
Last year, the company's natural gas production accounted for 93 percent of Russia's production and 20 percent of the world's total.

(Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan) Research Institute predicts that Hong Kong's economy will grow by about 6% in 2005.
Hong Kong, January 11 (Xinhua) The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Research Center of the University of Hong Kong said on Monday that the global economic environment is still optimistic this year.
The director of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Research Center, Mr Richard Wong, said at the "Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast" that although interest rates are expected to rise this year, the growth of Hong Kong's major trading partners is slow, and the economies of the United States and the mainland will grow by 3.6% and 8.5% respectively. However, the global economic environment in 2005 is still optimistic.
He said the center forecasts that Hong Kong's economy will maintain a growth of around 6% in 2005, while consumer prices at the end of the year will rise by 3%.
The labour market adjustment is still slow; the unemployment rate will drop slightly to about 6.3 per cent at the end of the year.
The instability caused by fluctuations in global oil prices remains a major uncertainty in the economy of Hong Kong.
The momentum of economic growth in the first quarter of this year will slow down and GDP will grow by 4.4 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a gradual weakening of Hong Kong's external demand. This is due to the slow economic growth of Hong Kong's major trading partners.

Hong Kong's strong economic growth in 2004 was mainly reflected in the strong economic growth of the local economy and the rapid growth of the mainland market economy.
