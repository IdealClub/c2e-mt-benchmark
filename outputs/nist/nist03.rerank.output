Scientists have completed the order of the chromosomes at the beginning of the year at the beginning of the year.
(Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd) - A group of scientists from the international community said that they have completed the order of the fourteenth of the human race, which is related to a number of diseases, including those in the early years.
This is the fourth pairs of chromosomes that have been completed so far, and it is made up of more than 800 million pairs of DNA (DNA).
The study published by the British natural science weekly shows that the fourteenth pairs of chromosomes are composed of 1,050 genes and gene segments.
The objective of genetic scientists is to provide diagnostic tools to detect defective genes from the disease and to provide treatment that can prevent these genes from creating obstacles.
International scientists led by genoscope, the French genetic research center, said that the fourteenth pair of genes and more than 60 types of disease genes have a vital immune system function.
In the previous studies carried out on many diseases, 14 pairs of chromosomes have been identified, including a paltry paralysis of young children, too little teeth, a number of visual and hearing damage, as well as the early detection of the disease.
There are about 200,000 people in the United States who are suffering from the early detection of the disease, which accounts for 5 percent of the total number of AIDS patients in the United States.
The human race has a total of 23 pairs of chromosomes.
Three pairs of chromosomes have been completed in the past three years, including 20, 21 and 22.
Australia Reopens Embassy in Manila
(AFP, Manila 2) Australia today reopened its embassy in the Philippines. Seven weeks ago, the embassy was closed because of the so-called terrorist attack.
In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines said that the Australian Ambassador to Manila, Pires, made a phone call to the foreign minister of the Philippines, Austria, to announce the resumption of the embassy's entire operation.
Canada, like the European Union and Australia, closed their embassies on November 28 and reopened this week.
He said that all three ambassadors are satisfied with the Philippine government's strengthening of security measures.
The closure of the embassy, which had provoked the government of the Philippines, said that the so-called threat was too exaggerated and that the embassy's image as an injury to the country had been damaged.
Manila had been exempted from the duties of police intelligence officers because he had revealed unconfirmed information about the terrorist threat in Australia and Canada.
The EU office is in the same building as the Australian Embassy.
Around the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, Western diplomatic missions in various parts of Southeast Asia were closed one after another because they were threatened by the Al-Qaeda group of Osama bin Laden and its local alliance.
Australian Foreign Minister Says North Korea will not be able to get more aid
(AFP, Sydney, 2) Australia has appealed to the international community to work together to convince North Korea that it will not be able to obtain more aid or other concessions in contempt of the ban on nuclear proliferation or other "bad acts."
Australian Foreign Minister Downer said today that Pyongyang had decided to restart a controversial nuclear facility and expel UN monitors. It was obviously aimed at forcing the international community to make concessions in aid and trade.
Australia is one of the few countries that have diplomatic relations with North Korea.
Downer said: "We believe that what North Korea wants to do is to obtain concessions, aid and trade from other countries in the world, including the United States, in violation of the agreed framework of the 1994 agreement."
Downer said in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Company that "what we have put forward to North Korea is also a very important point, that is, bad behavior will not be rewarded."
Downer pointed out that "the expulsion of United Nations monitors and the reopening of the Yongbyon nuclear facility will deter the international community from providing support."
"This will be counter-productive and we expect them to be effective."
"On the other hand, if we overreact, we will see North Korea.
We do not want to do that. "
Downer said that Australia was working closely with the United States and other major allies in order to force North Korea to rescind the recent steps taken to restore a frozen nuclear program.
"What we want to do is to ensure that there is a concerted international response. We do not wish to adopt a coordinated, ad hoc response," he said.
Bush to defend his economic plan
(AFP, Washington, June 6) US President Bush vowed that his upcoming economic revival plan will benefit the "working masses" and not just the rich and the rich. It is generally believed that the rich are expected to gain the greatest benefit from this big tax reduction plan.
"Tomorrow, you will hear me say: the US economy is one of the world's most powerful economies.
However, we believe that the US economy can still be stronger than at present. "
It is expected that President Bush will launch a 10-year economic revival plan of US $600 billion, half of which will be used to absorb the profits and taxes of shareholders, and urge the acceleration of the tax reduction plan adopted by US congressmen in 2001.
Whether or not this plan can be carried out smoothly is regarded as the front line of the 2004 US presidential election. The Democratic Party has criticized Bush's blueprint as not as good as that proposed by the Democratic Party.
The eight proposals put forward by the Democratic Party mainly revolve around an award of $136 billion to boost consumption. A total of US $100 billion will be spent in the next 10 years.
Speaking at a press conference held jointly with other members of the opposition, the head of the House Democratic Party, P\ x {7dcc}, said: "This is a fair, efficient and sound accounting plan."
Bush led the White House to refute allegations that the plan was only for the benefit of the rich. Bush said that his plan to revitalize the economy was mainly aimed at "boosting economic vitality and growth."
Bush said: "The scheme will offer tax concessions to the working class.
The scheme recognizes that people will be able to spend more money in order to create more job opportunities, "he said.
The United States wants to negotiate with North Korea but refuses to pay again.
(AFP, Washington, 7) The United States today expressed its willingness to negotiate with North Korea, which is an enemy of the "axis of evil", but it will not provide a new incentive for the Communist Party to lift its nuclear program.
US President Bush's government is currently facing a double crisis between Iraq and North Korea. After meeting with senior diplomats from Japan and South Korea, the Bush administration issued a statement, saying that this means that the US policy toward Pyongyang is "a step forward."
The statement said: "The US delegation has stated that it is willing to talk to North Korea about how it will meet its obligations to the international community.
However, the US delegation stressed that the United States would not provide any reward for North Korea to fulfill its existing obligations. "
US officials have insisted that although they are willing to negotiate with North Korea, they will not consider carrying out negotiation procedures prior to North Korea's compliance with the various agreements prohibiting nuclear weapons.
State Department spokesman Boucher said: "We are not willing to pay the price for the agreements reached in the past."
Prior to this, the Bush administration said that before North Korea gave up its nuclear program based on enriched uranium and turbulence, the United States refused to hold talks with this Swaziland country.
The former head of the real estate industry in the United States will plead guilty to the charge of fraud.
(AFP, Los Angeles) the prosecutor said that a former head of the real estate company, Homestore, had agreed to plead guilty to the alleged fraud and to settle a lawsuit against the insider trading scandal.
Special assistant inspectors of the United States said that the former senior buyer and manager of the housing shop, Mr. Karim, had agreed to plead guilty to a case of securities fraud involving insider trading.
Another prosecutor, Fox, said that Karim also agreed to pay US $70,000 for a civil action brought against him by the US stock exchange.
Willa said that the maximum penalty for the offence of securities fraud is 10 years' imprisonment, but the above-mentioned sentence is expected to be "substantially shortened" according to the plea of pleaded guilty.
According to the prosecution and investigators, in the case of the financial fraud involving Carina, the head of the housing shop was misleading the investors by using water in 2001.
Fox said that Karim, after knowing that the share price had been filled with water, took off the shares held by his own house. "Wall Street did not pay attention to the fact that the key part of the housing store was forged."
The former vice president of the housing shop, Mr David Tai, who was charged with the offence of insider trading, has pleaded guilty and is scheduled to be sentenced on April 21.
The operator of the housing shop, giacker, and the former financial secretary, Joseph Yam, pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiracy to engage in securities fraud.
The prosecutors said that gacker and Joseph Yam and other heads of companies were suspected of using their hands and feet in the accounts of the housing shops and poured water into the camp.
Traffic stoppage in Europe after several days of heavy snow
(AFP, Vienna, 8) several days of heavy snow, low temperatures in Siberia and strong winds in various parts of Europe have caused many deaths. Meanwhile, road, railway, air and sea traffic have also been disrupted.
The temperature in the Russian capital of Moscow last night fell to a level that even local people felt cold, leaving six people dead. This year the number of people killed in the cold has increased to 239. Most of them are drifters and elderly people, including many drunk people.
Three people died last night in Lithuania, and many others had to cut their legs and fingers because of frostbite.
The temperature in the Valencia region of the southern part of the country has reached a low of 32.6 degrees Celsius in 16 years.
On Monday, there were three Indian illegal immigrants who died because of cold and fatigue. The local temperature dropped to 20 degrees Celsius.
At the same time, civil defence units throughout Hong Kong and beyond have indicated that snowfall has caused road closures, delays in trains and paralysis of the airport.
The ice seal and road accidents along the British railway have paralyzed traffic in some areas. Heavy snow has been lowered in the eastern part of the country, and now the snow is moving westward.
The Czech Republic, which had a severe flooding in the summer of last year, had a low temperature of 18 degrees Celsius in the border area adjacent to Slovakia.
World research center pays tribute to environmental Revolution
(AFP, Washington, 9). In its annual report on the world situation, the environmental research organization, the World Watch Institute, praised the arrival of the "environmental revolution" in its annual report on the state of the world, pointing out that many countries are successfully curbing and solving environmental, health and social problems.
He said: "building a world that meets our needs while allowing the next generation to enjoy a healthy society is no longer a dream."
The world situation report indicates that one of the encouraging achievements is the growing use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and windmills, in Germany, Japan and Spain.
Speaking on the success of the renewable energy strategy, Buddha said: "We are entering a new era."
According to the aforesaid report, in the 1990s, the global production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) damaged the ozone layer of the ozone layer by 81 per cent.
In addition, the anti-polio campaign launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) has reduced the number of polio cases worldwide from 350,000 in 1988 to 480 in 2001.
The environmental research organization, based in Washington, has also praised local environmental achievements. For example, the Netherlands has achieved a recovery rate of 86 per cent; Denmark has completely banned the use of aluminium cans for recycling, and the use of renewable energy in Brazil in 2001.
The organization reported that past achievements had raised hopes for the lifting of the serious global threat, which included the daily loss of 7,000 human lives, as well as air, food and water pollution, which caused the death of 5,500 children every day.
US online Time Warner Chairman Casey will resign in May.
(AFP, Washington, December 12) US Time Warner Chairman Kose announced tonight that he would resign in May. He said that this move "is the best for the company."
He explained his decision by saying that he had decided to take the steps to avoid the shareholders' criticism that "our ability to cooperate as a team is obstructed, and the focus is entirely on our business."
The United States, agreed to by the US Federal Council in January 2001, will continue to be a director of the Time Warner board on the United States line with Time Warner.
When the merger was announced in January 2000, the total value was US $155 billion, which was agreed by European decision makers later in the year.
He said in a statement: "As you expect, this decision is very difficult for me personally. Since I hope to be the chairman of this big company in the next few years, and as a manufacturer of the merger, I have always believed that it is very important for me to remain as chairman and to assist in the track."
He stressed: "First of all, it is not necessary for the company to be disturbed at this critical moment, and because a number of shareholders still gather the disappointment of operation after the merger of the company, I have decided that we should take action now to prevent us from being hampered and focused entirely on our business."
On the US line, the Internet company of Time Warner says it expects that the advertising and commercial sales in 2002 will be reduced from $2.7 billion in 2001 to $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion.
The total sales volume would be US $8.8 billion to US $9 billion, compared with US $87.18 billion in the previous year.
The company expects that the total sales volume of the US line in 2003 will be almost unchanged from that in 2002, while the number of advertisements and commercial sales will be reduced by 40 to 50%.
North Korea's withdrawal from nuclear non-proliferation treaty will be an enemy of the whole world
(AFP, Washington, 15) The showcards of the United States and North Korea have risen from the issue of the "axis of evil" to an international crisis. Over the past few decades, global nuclear non-proliferation efforts have come to naught.
Pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty on the 10th of this month, dropping into a situation of confrontation with Washington.
Analysts said that the world is now in danger of failing in its efforts to curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and that this treaty has been seriously damaged by the non-signatories, India and Pakistan, when they entered the nuclear club in 1998.
Four days after Pyongyang took the above action, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council took preventive diplomacy for the crisis.
Russia said it would send a special envoy to Pyongyang to propose an end to the impasse, while China proposed to host a compromise dialogue between the United States and North Korea.
Britain and France are discussing the crisis in London.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has warned that if Pyongyang refuses to give up its nuclear program, it may ask the Security Council to take action.
With regard to the actions of Russia and China, many US observers believe that such talks may force Moscow and Beijing to decide whether or not to cast a veto on North Korea.
Other countries that may have nuclear capability, such as Iran and Libya, will definitely pay close attention to the development of the North Korean crisis.
They will pay attention to the fact that North Korea's withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will not be punished, or that it will receive huge funds from the United States to stop the development of nuclear weapons.
Former State Department arms control official Ai Enhong said: "If North Korea is considered capable of withdrawing from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, they may think that they can take the same action without paying the price."
Norrand of the international economic research institute believed that North Korea might have made a tactical mistake because the decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty would make the international resolve to resolve the issue more resolute.
Japanese court rejects huge compensation suit for former Chinese slave workers
(AFP, Tokyo, 15) a court in Japan today dismissed a claim for compensation of 132 million yen (US $1.1 million), which was put forward by six Chinese people who were forced to work as slaves in a nickel mine in Japan during the second world war.
Nanwood, a judge of the Kyoto District Court, said that although the government and the Japanese metallurgical industry had committed a joint wrongful act in 1944, the limitation period for which he sought compensation based on civil law was 20 years, and dismissed the action.
He said: "The responsibility of the defendant has come to an end."
Five former Chinese slave workers, including 72 years of age, and a slave worker, sought unpaid wages, compensation and apologies from the Japanese government and the Japanese metallurgical industry company.
The six men used to work in the metallurgical industry of Japan for one year. During this period, they were often beaten and unable to get enough to eat.
The Japanese metallurgical industry argued that the company was not in a position to resist the policies implemented by the state, while the Japanese government indicated that it did not have to pay compensation to the plaintiffs in accordance with the constitution at that time.
The current affairs News Agency reported that after the court announced its judgment, Liu Zongkun said at a press conference: "This is a lack of humane judgment."
He said that they would have to file an appeal.
Liu said: "I won the support of many Japanese friends, and I will fight to the end."
The plaintiff's lawyer pointed out that the ruling was "a violation of history" and demanded compensation and apologies from the Japanese government and the Japanese metallurgical industry in order to solve the problem.
Kyodo News reported that in war compensation proceedings, this was the first time that such defences were rejected.
In 1944, the Japanese army arrested about 200 Chinese people, and then sent them to the great mountains and nickel mines in the capital of Beijing.
Akayesu says sales growth nearly 30 percent in the fourth quarter of last year
(AFP, Paris) according to Alcatel, a manufacturer of French telecommunications equipment, which was hit hard by the slump in the telecommunications industry, the sales figure for the fourth quarter of 2002 should be able to show a growth of nearly 30 percent compared to the previous quarter.
This growth reflects seasonal factors that are more than expected, as well as a steady flow of broadband and operational infrastructure equipment.
Akayesu said that following the inclusion of 150 million euros (US $158.4 million) in reserve reserves, the revenues from the fourth quarter will be close to two points.
Akayesu said in a statement that cost reduction measures are being carried out according to plan.
The Paris stock market expressed welcome to Akayesu's announcement, which had a big increase of 16.91 percent at the end of the afternoon transaction, at a rate of 6.5 euros per unit.
Global Securities analyst Barko said, "the fourth quarter sales figures are particularly surprising."
Serge tchurk, chairman of Akayesu, said that he still anticipates that Akayesu will be able to reduce its profit and loss to 3 billion euros by the end of 2003, which means that it will be profitable to have less sales.
Akayesu also said that the company's annual income figures will be announced on February 4.
Japan is expected to grow by 1.5% in real terms as soon as 2006
(AFP, Tokyo) according to a report in the Japanese economic news today, the Japanese government's economic and financial consultation has extended the Japanese economy to a forecast period of more than 1.5% growth in real terms for two years to 2006 fiscal year.
The economic and financial consultative conference also expects that the total amount of treasury bonds to be issued in each of the next five years will be as high as 40 trillion yen, as the budget deficit is expected to be longer than originally anticipated.
The report says that the mid-term economic outlook report, aimed at outlining the economic and financial operating guidelines for the next five years, is scheduled to be finalized on the 20th of this month.
The mid-term economic outlook report was first completed in early January last year, and the economic and financial consultative conference is now in the process of being revised and is expected to be approved by a cabinet meeting by the end of this month.
The report says that the current version of the mid-term economic outlook report and a trial run by the cabinet are expected to reach 1.5% in real terms in 2004, compared with 2.7 percent in 2005.
However, the revised version is expected to grow by only 0.9% in real terms in 2004 and by 0.8 of a percentage point in nominal terms.
The report says that the revised version of the report also predicts that it will not be possible to achieve a growth rate of 1.5% or more in the fiscal year of 2006.
For the fiscal year 2007, there will be a growth rate of 2.5 per cent or more, which is two years later than the original estimate.
The report points out that the revised outlook report will also move out of the deflation schedule for two years.
Australia faces one of the most serious forest fires in 50 years
(AFP, Sydney, Jan. 18) Australia's forest fire is rampant. Today, nearly 40 houses have been destroyed, threatening the home in the suburbs of the capital city of Canberra. With strong winds and rising temperatures, the fire is expected to expand further.
Australian officials said that unconfirmed reports indicated that the fire had caused the death of one person and the disappearance of several people in dozens of rural towns and towns around Canberra, as well as in other regions of the Australian capital.
Federal police Brown said that police are trying to confirm that at least one person was buried in the caves, but it was confirmed that some people were missing.
As a result of the strong winds caused by strong winds in the mountains of Kandahar, south and west, the authorities in the capital territory have declared a state of emergency in the region today.
On the other hand, the fire authorities said that because of the fact that the forest is close to the area of concentration, several thousand firemen have been recruited to join the fire fighting.
Under the threat of the most serious forest fire in 50 years, the people of mountains and towns in the mountains and towns of Kosciuszko, New South Wales, have been evacuated as a matter of urgency.
He said: "The situation is very harsh, and the snow mountains may be facing the most serious threat in 50 years." More than 1,000 fire fighters are fighting a battle that is on the decline. It is impossible to block the 80,000 hectares of land in the New South Wales province.
The Japanese emperor ming-jen underwent a successful operation to remove the cancer of the cancer.
(Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 18) the Japanese emperor ming-jen underwent an operation today to remove the symptoms of cancer. A doctor from the royal family said that the operation had been carried out smoothly and that the cancer had not spread to other organs.
At a press conference held at a hospital attached to the University of Tokyo, the chief medical officer of the Palace Museum said: "The operation was carried out smoothly as scheduled, and the operation was successfully completed.
His Majesty, who had been on the horizon, spoke with the Queen and the princess, who had accompanied him. "
"We are of the view that (cancer) has not spread," he added.
He said that doctors would conduct further tests in order to determine that cancer was limited to taking care of the state.
The operation was carried out by six doctors for a period of three hours and 40 minutes.
The 69-year-old man was in 1989. This was the first time the Japanese emperor underwent an operation at a hospital outside the imperial palace hospital for the first time.
The doctor said that ming-jen was scheduled to rest for about a month.
Jinze said that at the time of the surgery, there was not much bleeding, but the doctor only used his blood to receive blood transfusions.
Before the operation, the doctor had already stored his blood in advance and the quantity was not known.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda said that the government is pleased with the success of the Japanese emperor's operation and hopes that he will recover soon.
A government official said that shortly before Ming Yan was admitted to the hospital, the 42-year-old Crown Prince Naruhito had temporarily assumed the constitutional duty of the Japanese emperor.
This is the first time that the Japanese emperor has transferred his duties due to illness and hospitalization.
Philippines forces to combat threat from Communist Party guerrillas
(AFP, Manila, 20) the Philippine security forces are assembling various units to combat a large number of attacks by Communist Party guerrillas in several areas of the Southeast Asian islands.
Brigadier General Pristina said today that the New People's Army was "attempting to build troops in certain areas", including the northern part of the Philippines, the southern provinces of Manila and a number of central islands.
He added: "They have stepped up their attacks on certain areas where they believe their military strength is weak," or "attacking and attacking troops in sparsely populated areas".
Other officials said that the new people's army had stepped up attacks on so-called "soft" targets, such as telecommunications and power facilities.
Last week, the head of the National Police, ebudan, asked telecommunications companies to carry out security investments worth hundreds of millions of dollars in order to prevent attacks by the New People's Army.
"The armed forces have redeployed more troops to areas most likely to be threatened," he said.
Prifika said that the number of people in the New People's Army has decreased by at least 23 percent from 12,000 to 13,000 people two years ago to about 9,000.
Of these, at least 5,000 are "armed forces". In early 2001, there were about 6,000 people.
He said that the government troops drove them off in more than 400 villages where the New People's Army often appeared.
He said: "We are slowly but determined to win the confidence of the people."
National Security Advisor Gao Liz said last week that the new people's army had suffered serious military and political setbacks, forcing it to return to the negotiating table with its source, the Philippine Communist Party.
After the rebels assassinated two members of the National Assembly, Philippine President Arroyo suspended negotiations with the Communist Party in mid-2001.
Last year, the United States included the New People's Army and the Philippine Communist Party in its international blacklist of "foreign terrorist organizations."
Washington, Canada and many western European governments have also agreed to trace and put an end to the foreign financial sources of the rebels and to freeze their overseas assets.
Growth of cell phone users in mainland China will slow down
(AFP report from Beijing on the 21st) this year, the number of new cell phone users in mainland China is expected to be reduced to 52 million.
Last year, it was 61.9 million.
However, the Beijing Morning Post today quoted the forecast of the Ministry of Information Industry as saying that this goal may be underestimated.
In January last year, the Ministry of Information Industry predicted that there were 55 million new users of cell phones in those years, but the actual figure was 61.9 million.
At the end of last year, there were 60.6 million cell phone users in mainland China, an increase of 42.7% over the previous year.
Beijing said that in July of last year, mainland China had become the world's largest fixed and cell phone market.
In the previous year, cell phone users had become the highest in the world.
The report says that at the same time, the Information Industry Minister Wu Jichuan predicted that in the past year, the decline in fixed asset investment will be suspended this year, but the amount of investment may be the same.
Last year, the investment in fixed assets of postal electricity decreased by 20% to 2.06 billion yuan.
Telecommunications industry investment accounted for 97% of the total amount of investment.
Wu Jichuan predicted that this year, the investment in fixed assets of the postal industry will reach 230 billion yuan, slightly lower than last year.
The report says that the Ministry of Information Industry forecasts that this year the number of new fixed network telephone users is 3 million, which is lower than the 35.4 million last year.
At the end of December of last year, the number of fixed network telephone users in mainland China reached 272 million, an increase of 35 million compared to the previous year.
Wu Jichuan also pledged to strengthen competition and speed up the establishment of a telecommunications regulatory body.
He said: "the optimization of telecommunications control has become the most important issue in the telecommunications industry.
We will speed up the drafting of the telecommunications law, amend the postal law and the wireless telecommunications regulations. "
World Health Organization Begins Election of New President
(AFP, Geneva, 21) the nomination process for the new president of the World Health Organization (WHO) is expected to start in the coming week.
Starting today, the meeting of the Executive Council of the World Health Organization (WHO) will reduce the list of candidates to five and, on 28 January, a person will be nominated to take over from the outgoing president of the Norwegian Parliament, Ms. brentransde.

Foreign officials said that among the candidates for the election of the president, the three most optimistic people are: Mozambican Prime Minister Mozambique, the head of the UN AIDS prevention and treatment program, and the director of the World Health Organization's plan to prevent the spread of tuberculosis.
Under an unwritten rule, the United Nations has made every effort to enable its principal organs to be held by persons from different parts of the globe.
Some western diplomats admitted that Piot, as a European, was in a disadvantageous position from the beginning.
A diplomat said: "Now it is the turn of the people of the South."
Labor Minister calls for independent producers to help safeguard freedom of speech
(Agence France-Presse, Jan. 20) in the war against terror in the United States, the idol of the screen, robreton, called on the independent producer to work together to prevent the erosion of freedom of speech.
He pointed out that his speech was an indirect attack on the policies of the Bush administration.
Lefu warned that the freedom of speech and other basic rights of the United States are being threatened, and that independently produced films can help safeguard other types of artistic and political viewpoints.
He said: "One of the advantages of independent production is that it does not have the burden of commercial doctrines, nor is it restricted in expressing different views."
Laura Li, founder of the Japanese dance film festival, said that he is prepared to revise the rules of this annual independent producer's event and to allow their works to be shown in big cities in the United States.
The film festival has a history of 22 years since the film festival was held in the Utah city.
"Freedom of speech is our most precious virtue, and we must bear in mind that freedom of speech is our most precious virtue," he said.
OPEC founder: Iraq war will cause oil prices to rise to 100 yuan
(Agence France-Presse, durha, 21) - the former Arab oil minister of Saudi Arabia said that if Iraq burned the oil field in the US-led war, it would raise the price of crude oil to US $100 per barrel.
One of the founders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said last night that Hussein would destroy the Iraqi oil wells; strategic oil reserves would drop as a result. At the same time, oil prices could reach 80 to 100 US dollars per barrel. "
At a press conference in the capital of Kabul, he said: "If the United States attacks Iraq, it may lead to a world disaster."
He further pointed out that "the bombing of oil reserves and the oil industry in Iraq may lead to a substantial increase in crude oil prices to 80 to 100 US dollars."
Armanani said: "The US military action against Iraq will destroy the oil wells and cause serious instability throughout the country. This will lead to a sharp rise in oil prices and will lead to a recession in the world economy."
North Korea delegation: North Korea does not intend to produce nuclear weapons
(AFP, Seoul) South Korean officials said that the North Korean delegation attending the ministerial meeting between North and South Korea said today that North Korea has no intention of producing nuclear weapons.
South Korean delegation spokesman Rhee Bong-jo said, "North Korea emphasizes that it does not intend to produce nuclear weapons."
On the occasion of the first round of formal talks, Rhee Bong-jo said that following South Korea's urging the Pyongyang regime to renounce its nuclear ambition, the North Korean delegation made the above remarks.
Rhee Bong-jo said: "The South Korean side stressed that if the nuclear issue has not been resolved, the entire South and South Korea relations will not be able to continue to move forward."
Rhee Bong-jo also said, "We hope that through this round of talks, North Korea can be persuaded to take more concrete steps," so as to reverse its decision to reopen the production of plutonium nuclear facilities.
The South and South Korea ministerial talks will focus on reconciliation and humanitarian issues. However, South Korea, as a traditional United States member of the United States, has said that the Seoul authorities have taken advantage of this opportunity to express the international community's concern over the nuclear impasse.
North Korea claimed that this nuclear impasse only involves the bilateral issues of the United States. Intervention by other countries will only complicate the issue.
Kmart, the largest chain store in the United States, is expected to gain early profits.
(Agence France-Presse, Michigan) - the largest chain retailer of the United States, Kmart, said that after a year of restructuring, the company will be able to get out of the bankruptcy situation in 2004 and return to profits.
Kmart's reorganization plan the day before yesterday was mainly based on two investment companies, ESL investment and the third largest capital foundation in New York. The two investment companies are preparing to invest US $350 million to save the Kmart company.
However, the scheme has not been endorsed by the loan banks, investors and suppliers.
This chain retailer, which has a century of history, said that it will continue to communicate with the creditor committee and hope to get out of the predicament of bankruptcy by April 30.
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce are investigating the Kmart company on the grounds that the senior executives are suspected of making money.
The company's board of directors also carried out an internal investigation and stated earlier that it had found "reliable and convincing evidence", indicating that the 10 executive heads were in breach of management responsibilities.
Kmart declared bankruptcy a year ago, after a loss of US $2.4 billion in 2001.
It is estimated that it will suffer a loss of $3.260 billion in 2002 and said earlier that the company would suffer a loss of $268 million this year.
Kmart has closed a total of 283 shops. At the same time, a total of 22,000 people have been laid off. At present, there are plans to close 300 shops and lay off some 37,000 people.
Powell: US has more than 10 allies supporting Iraq's war on Iraq
(AFP, Switzerland, 25) US Secretary of State Powell said that the US plan to attack Iraq was supported by more than 10 allies.
At this time, he is preparing a script related to the US policy to attend the World Economic Forum.
Under tight security measures, Powell arrived in a ski resort in Switzerland, where he will deliver a speech at the annual gathering of global political and business leaders on Sunday.
At the same time, anti-globalization protesters also gathered there.
The concern about the outbreak of war in Iraq has cast a shadow over this year's meeting.
Participating member states of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) today managed to ease their doubts about possible disruption of the world's oil supply once the United States launched an attack on Iraq.
Powell told reporters here that "a considerable number of countries have already indicated that they will act in concert with us." He also said that even if the UN Security Council does not support war, the attitude of these countries will not change.
Powell said: "We are not alone.
As far as I can remember, I can cite more than a dozen countries. At the same time, I think that more countries will show their support. "
Officials from the United States said that Powell would hold separate talks with Turkish Prime Minister Downer and Australian Prime Minister Alexander Downer during the meeting.
Turkey is an important NATO ally of the United States and is resisting pressure to join us under the leadership of the United States.
The Australian government, on the other hand, pledged to participate in the war despite domestic opposition.
Daher pointed out that President Bush should come up with concrete evidence that Hussein is violating the law.
(AFP, WASHINGTON, Jan. 28) Senate Democratic leader da Hill challenged President Bush on the evidence of Iraq's possession of powerful weapons. He also questioned whether the White House had a set of "guiding principles" to justify the attack on Hussein.
Daher asked: "If we have evidence of Iraq's possession of nuclear and biological weapons, why are we not public? Just as President Kennedy took photographs of Cuba's offensive missiles 40 years ago, he immediately instructed the ambassador to the United Nations to make an announcement at the UN General Assembly."
It was at a time when the UN Security Council reported to the UN Security Council whether Iraq was complying with the arms reduction order.
He said: "As we begin to engage in a war against terrorism, the people of the United States have the right to know why thousands of US troops are going to risk their lives in the battlefield. The United States has to spend billions of dollars to offend the allies and provoke its opponents to attack Iraq."
He said: "in a democratic country, the president should try his best to dispel people's doubts and resolve the people's worries. This is very important."
He pointed out that public opinion polls showed that the American people's support for President Bush was declining.
The White House used various reasons to explain the urgency of overthrowing Hussein, including threatening neighboring countries, poisoning the Kurds, attempting to kill former President Bush, accused of attacks on the September 11 attacks, making weapons of mass destruction, and so on.
"People cannot help but doubt that the government has the highest guiding principles," he said.
Flooding caused by flooding in parts of northwest Australia
(Agence France-Presse, Australia, 28). At a time when many parts of Australia were ravaged by drought and forest fires, there was a flood of flooding in parts of the northwestern part of the country.
Today, the disaster relief authorities are required to transport fresh food supplies to the town of Paula in the province of kataliya in Queensland province, which has been under siege for nearly three weeks.
In the past, the town was plagued by widespread flooding. In the past, flooding had caused the town to be cut off from the outside world for several months.
However, the head of the local council, tenino, said that this year the town of Bulgaria was hit by a sudden flood.
He said: "Without fresh milk, fruits or vegetables, bread is limited. Before the road is reopened, there are only some food stocks."
"As a result of the sudden flooding, the last lorry entering the town was trapped. The goods vehicle entered the town on the 22nd. We had a break with the outside world that evening," he said.
He said that the water level has dropped in the past few days. If it does not rain, the roads will be ready for traffic this week.
His restaurant owner trede said that he was very careful to ensure the supply of beer. As a result of the flooding, he was unable to go to a bar to drink liquor.
He said, "they are drinking, playing cards and fishing to kill time."
"A large number of floods have now been replaced by mud. Therefore, even if the water on the roads has gradually subsided, it is still impossible to get through."
Thousands of olive trees to decorate Athens Olympic venues
(AFP, Athens, 28) about 4,000 old olive trees will be transplanted into the 2004 Olympic marathon and other Olympic Games venues.
These olive trees will be transplanted from the distant island of Crete and the island of Sapporo.
According to the Athens Olympic preparatory committee, these trees will be eliminated sooner or later because of local construction projects.
The Athens Olympic preparatory committee said that, at present, the olive trees were temporarily stored in preparation for the replanting of 1,500 old olive trees along the 42.2 km marathon route in the future.
The rest of the trees will be planted in other Olympic Games venues.
Olive trees are a common scene in Greece. The recently published Olympic torch is the shape of the olive tree, and its inspiration comes from olive trees.
An official of the Olympic preparatory commission said: "This initiative represents the Preparatory Committee's sensitivity to environmental protection."
It will cost 3 million euros to carry out greening work along the marathon.
Protesters and people from neighboring communities said that the marathon route damaged the local environment, and some areas of the competition will be widened to destroy the original scenery that has so far been preserved.
Environmentalists also complain that many trees have been wiped out in some areas of Athens because of the Olympic Games related to the Olympic Games.
Exit polls: the joint party led by Sharon won the Israeli general election
(AFP, Jerusalem, 28th) -- Israel held a parliamentary election today. According to the results of a public opinion poll conducted on the exit polls, the rightist United Party led by current Prime Minister Sharon will win 32 to 36 of the 120 seats in the Congress.
Sharon's office said that the leader of the main opposition Labor Party, Mizher, had admitted defeat and called him on the phone.
It is estimated that the Labor Party will get 17 to 19 seats, lower than the original 25 seats. This will be the worst result of the Labor Party election since the founding of Israel in 1948.
The middle class Reform Party is expected to be greatly reduced, from only six seats in the last Congress to 14 to 17 seats, thus posing a threat to the position of the second largest party in the Labor Party.
It is expected that the party will have nine to 13 seats, less than the current 17 seats.
The above estimates were made public by public and private television channels following the closure of the polling station at 10: 00 p.m.
United Party cadres said that they have already started talks in the hope that they can form a functioning coalition government, but the leader of the Labor Party, Mizher, has ruled out the possibility of joining the Sharon government.
Members of the Congress of the United States of America and Congress plan to reorganize their parliament.
(AFP, WASHINGTON, Jan. 29) US congressmen denounced the competing leaders of the country and vowed to reorganize the national Olympics, which is the most abundant in the world.
The Special Olympics in the United States have not been very effective, and there have been fierce internal problems and problems in the past.
The Senate is planning to hold a hearing in February to study the relevant practice. The congressmen who set up the United States Olympic Committee in 1978 are now in the process of restructuring to arouse the confidence of US athletes, supporters and sponsors.
He said: "If we want to rebuild people's confidence in the United States Olympics, then we will have to restructure and restructure.
We must propose ways to restructure the United States Olympics in order to prevent the recurrence of the current problems. "
There has been a fierce dispute, like that of a child, between the United States Olympic Committee chief executive Goldwater, the chairman of the Olympic Committee, and the chief executive officer of the Olympic Committee who resigned last week.
Republican Senator Campbell said, "if the quarrel can also win a gold medal, the Olympic officials involved in this dispute will be entitled to a gold medal."

For the first time this year, Indonesia will designate the lunar new year as a national holiday. This is a victory for the Chinese people to fight against widespread discrimination for a long time. Now they are happy to welcome the Spring Festival.
Russian Expert: space shuttle disaster may cause space station to be suspended
(AFP, Moscow) a Russian space expert pointed out that the unfortunate incident of the dissolution of the US space shuttle Columbia on its way back to the earth could lead to the temporary suspension of the international space station, which was carried out by the United States space shuttle and the Russian spaceship.
The Russian space expert, who did not want to be named, told the Russian media international fax that the incident of the dissolution of Colombia when it returned to the atmosphere would force the astronauts on the space station to return to the ground to open the automatic system of the space station for a period of time.
He said that if the cause of the accident was determined to be the result of a space shuttle, the US side would freeze all space shuttle missions in order to prevent similar disasters from happening again.
He further pointed out that it is very likely that the United States will send the astronauts to the space station after 2007 or 2008, and it is necessary to build a new spaceship.
The United States and Russia are facing serious financial constraints, and the United States and Russia may reach an agreement to make use of the United States to maintain the space station for the international space station.
The Russian expert believes that at present the astronauts on the international space station are scheduled to return to Earth on March 1 by the US space shuttle. They should remain on the space station today.
The international space station program includes 16 countries including the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada, and France.
The Russian experts pointed out that the tragic incident on 1 July showed that the space shuttle was not reliable, and that Russia had an accident in 1971. At that time, the spaceship crashed while returning to Earth and damaged the three astronauts on the spaceship.
The new president of the Czech Republic, Haoui, has not yet been confirmed.
(Agence France-Presse, Prague, 2) - playwright Haoui, who became a hero in the democratic movement during the rule of the Czech Communist Party, bid farewell to his public life today and unloaded him as an elected president for 13 years.
In a television interview he thanked the people for their trust in him. He said: "Without your understanding and goodwill, I will not be able to stay in my office for a while."
Despite serious health problems, Haoui is still under great pressure. Now, even though his successor has not yet confirmed, he still has to step down as scheduled.
Harvi took office on December 29, 1989 when he spoke to the public for the first time on his balcony in bragburg. Earlier today, he said: "After 13 years as president, I have to say goodbye to all of you."
This 66-year-old writer, who was originally a dissident, was later transformed into a world-class politician, which also symbolizes the victory of democracy in Europe.
After the outbreak of the Czech revolution, Haoui, who was once a prisoner under the communist regime, became the president.
Three years later, the Czech Republic was divided into two countries, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which continued to serve as the president of the Czech Republic.
He expressed the hope that the president of the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of China will continue to play a leading role in the development of the relations between the two countries.
The Czech parliament held a meeting last month to elect a new president, but the results were inconclusive on January 15 and 24.
British predictions finally support UN Security Council's authorization to attack Iraq
(AFP, London 3) the British government believes that French President Chirac will eventually support the second resolution of the UN Security Council authorizing the attack on Iraq.
British media reported today that Chirac and British Prime Minister Blair will meet tomorrow in Le Touquet, northern France, to exchange views on the latest developments in the Iraq crisis.
The headline was: "Downing Street predicted a change of position toward Iraq." The Guardian also quoted sources from the British Prime Minister's Office as saying that four factors would affect schhark's acceptance of Britain's thinking.
He was surprised to find that seven European countries had taken a unanimous stand with the United Kingdom and signed a pro-US letter on the Iraq issue last week.
The Times quoted a British diplomat as saying that he liked to attract a lot of attention, but he was not stupid. Perhaps tomorrow he would expect to see a change of 180 degrees. But he still hopes to see signs of a change of attitude at the leaders' summit of the two countries.
Nearly 3,000 US troops stationed in South Korea ordered to freeze defense
(AFP, Seoul, 3) The US military claimed that about 2,900 US generals and soldiers who are scheduled to be removed from South Korea in the next three months have been ordered to freeze their defense in order to maintain the military readiness of the garrison.
This freezing of military orders is not directly related to the North Korean nuclear crisis, but it shows that the United States has to deal with the problems faced by Iraq and North Korea on both sides.
The Eighth Army Corps stationed in Seoul said today that they have received a freeze order to maintain the size of the US military in South Korea. At the same time, the replacement plan for US military units in the United States has been suspended.
Lieutenant General kaner, commander of the Eighth Corps of the US military, issued a statement, which is aimed at ensuring the strength of the US military in South Korea.
According to the defense treaty signed between South Korea and the United States, there are about 37,000 US troops stationed in South Korea. Since the development of North Korea's nuclear program in December last year, the US military in South Korea has been maintaining vigilance.
Suspected space shuttle wreckage also found in California and Arizona
(AFP, Houston) the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said that the wreckage of the Columbia space shuttle was also found in California and Arizona in the west of the United States. This may provide an important clue as to why the space shuttle would collapse in the air.
"We have received many reports of debris found on the surface of California and Arizona," deputy director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said.
He said that a panel of experts had been able to check the wreckage at various locations in those states, but it was carefully pointed out that it was not yet clear what it was.
Charles Dickens, manager of the space shuttle program, said on the 3rd that the department has formed a special team to search for wreckage in the area west of Texas and Louisiana, where most of the wreckage of space shuttle was found.
He pointed out that this type of wreckage could be of major importance because it could provide a critical missing part of the cause of the accident.
The Columbia space shuttle fell on the 1st at 9: 16 a.m. (10: 16 p.m. Taipei time) before landing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Seven astronauts on the space shuttle were killed in the air.
Investigators are trying to find out why the temperature of the left side of the space shuttle was up to 16 degrees Celsius a few minutes prior to the interruption of the communication, causing an unusual movement on the left side of the space shuttle at about the same time, causing the space shuttle to get out of control.
Kostnik said that it was considered important to clarify the cause of the accident that the possibility of finding the wreckage in the West was considered to be of great importance in clarifying the cause of the accident.
"It is essential to examine the wreckage in the early stages of the crash," he said.
South Korean special envoy calls for dialogue between the United States and North Korea
(AFP, Washington, 4) US President Bush faced a strong demand from the next government of South Korea and important allies of the US Congress to urge Washington to hold direct talks with North Korea in order to prevent the nuclear crisis from getting out of hand.
Bush's senior assistant had no choice but to defend Washington's policy toward North Korea, one day after he ordered the heavy bombers to be ready to deploy and thus arouse the anger of North Korea.
After meeting with Secretary of State Powell, the special envoy of President Roh Moo-hyun, who is about to come to power in South Korea, emphasized South Korea's position: "We hope that the United States will take a more active role in dialogue with North Korea."
He also said that the dialogue between the United States and North Korea should be carried out multilaterally on international occasions.
At the same time, Republican Foreign Affairs senior Senator ruchia also made a strong appeal to the United States to engage in dialogue with North Korea.
He said: "I believe that US officials should hold talks with North Korean officials to discuss how to seek an end to North Korea's nuclear weapons program through an international thorough inspection agreement."
Powell's deputy Armitage told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the talks between US and North Korean officials were only a matter of time, and not a question of whether or not to talk.
Armitage said, "of course, there is no doubt that we will have direct talks with North Korea."
However, he said that Washington must hold this dialogue only when it is satisfied that a "strong international public opinion" has been established to support the end of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.
The unemployment rate in Germany in January has risen to a new high in five years.
(AFP, Frankfurt) according to official data, the bad weather and the prolonged economic downturn in the winter have caused Germany's unemployment rate to rise to a new high in January this year, bringing another heavy blow to German Chancellor Straw, who has just been re-elected for more than 100 days.
In addition, with the threat of a possible war in Iraq, the economy of Germany, the largest economy in the eurozone, has become more and more bleak.
The freeze on the German labour market seems likely to continue in the next few months.
According to information released by the German Federal Labour Department, the number of people looking for jobs in Germany has risen sharply to 4.623,000 or 11.1 percent of the German labour force. The unemployment rate in January has set a new high for the five years since March 1988.
In December last year, the total number of unemployed persons reached 425,000, with an unemployment rate of 10.1%.
For seasonal reasons, the number of unemployed people in Germany will generally increase during the winter months, as most companies, especially the construction industry, have laid off their employees due to inclement weather.
However, even if this is taken into account, the number of people applying for unemployment assistance last month has continued to grow.
The seasonally adjusted data released by the central bank of Frankfurt, Germany, showed that the total number of unemployed people in January increased sharply to 4,274,000 from 412,000 in December last year.
Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate has increased from 10.1% to 10.3%.
The head of the Federal Labour Office, gester, has brought about a sharp increase in the number of people looking for jobs as a result of the unusual winter weather and economic hardship.
Singapore Economic Review Conference: the economy is expected to recover fully in 2004
(AFP, Singapore 6) the Singapore Economic Review Committee said that due to global geopolitical and economic tension, the Singapore economy will not be able to recover fully until 2004.
In its annual inspection report, the Singapore Economic Review Commission said, "the economy of Singapore has not yet completely recovered from the recession since 2001. There is too much instability in the region, the economic slowdown in Europe and Japan, the imminent outbreak of the Iraq war, and the major challenges in mainland China have cast a shadow over the recent economic prospects of Singapore."
But there is still reasonable growth in Singapore's economy this year, but a full recovery may have to wait until 2004.
The Singapore government estimates that after the economic growth of 2.2 percent last year, it is expected to grow by 2 to 5 percent this year, but it is still far below the average annual growth rate of 7.3% in Singapore since 1985.
It also recommended that the government should extend the scheme to restore the rate of payment of employers' provident funds. Two years later, it would consider raising the rate of payment of employers' provident funds, so as to avoid increasing the burden on employers during the current difficult period, helping to reduce the unemployment rate and send a strong message to foreign investors.
Yao Ming feels the idol of the NBA has come too fast.
(AFP, Atlanta, Georgia, 8) the Chinese Yao Ming, who has become the latest basketball idol of the United States, met with more than 100 reporters who tried hard to capture his speech. However, in the midst of chaos, Yao Ming still showed the calm and wisdom of Confucius.
This 22-year-old rocket, a 22-year-old rocket team, will serve as the first player to become the first Asian NBA star player in the 52nd United States All-Star Game to be held here tomorrow.
Other NBA star players, such as Duncan and Ellison, are much more lonely than the long Chinese who have attracted the attention of soccer fans around the world.
Yao Ming said, "the attention received is quite obvious. This is just one side of the pressure I have to bear. This is a very special thing.
I hope to stay in a hotel room, but as a basketball player, this may well be an ambition that I cannot achieve. "
But when most people look at you, you can only see your bellies, and your face is constantly appearing in television advertisements. This is most likely to be a luxury.
When you are making money in millions of United States dollars and replacing the person Jordan as the main salesman of basketball, it is inevitable that you will be in a chaotic situation.
Yao Ming said, "everything happened too fast and too fast.
You don't want to have everything at the beginning. You want to gradually integrate into the NBA, not like that.
But all this is not for you. "

The last competition was held on October 10 last year in Feldstein, Germany, when he was shot down by Russian athlete Dickens.
Xiao Wei, who won four consecutive championships, frankly admitted that she was a great incentive for her to achieve today's achievements.
Bush pledges to disarm Iraqi armed forces in various ways
(AFP, Washington, 14) US President Bush pledged today that "all kinds of measures" will be used to disarm the Iraqi President Hussein's regime.
He alleged: "Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction and has used them; Hussein is in the habit of deceiving the world and continues to do so.
Hussein has also established relations with the network of terrorist organizations. "
In his speech at the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) headquarters, Bush said, "Hussein is a dangerous element, and that is the reason why he will be disarmed in various ways."
This is Bush's first public response to the UN Security Council meeting held in New York today.
The main purpose of the meeting was to listen to the report on Iraq's compliance with Resolution 1441 adopted by the UN Security Council on 8 November last year.
White House spokesman Fleischer said that brikes did not provide any reason to believe that Iraq was complying with UN Security Council resolution 1441.
He told the reporter, "today the world has not received any comfort from news from New York, and it is believed that Hussein has shown that he is being disarmed.
The reverse is the case. "
When asked when the United States will come up with a follow-up resolution aimed at implementing Resolution 1441 of the Security Council, it is too early to say "it is too early", but the United States will discuss its content with its allies.
Countries such as France, Russia and China still advocate strengthening the arms inspection of Iraq, and do not want the United States to lead the war against Iraq.
He said: President Bush is also of the view that military action is a "last resort."
However, he insisted on the timetable set by Bush, saying that the United Nations had only a few weeks rather than a few months to try to promote the peaceful disarmament of Iraq, followed by military action.
New York Times: White House develops sanctions against North Korea
(AFP, Washington) the New York Times quoted US officials today as saying that the White House is in the process of developing sanctions as soon as the Pyongyang authorities have failed to renounce their development of nuclear weapons.
The report points out that these sanctions will include preventing the shipment of weapons by North Korea and cutting off the remittances of North Korean people living in Japan to North Korea's pipelines.
The report points out that officials of the Pentagon and the State Council are in the process of formulating detailed plans for sanctions to enable the United States to respond at any time when North Korea takes new measures to develop nuclear weapons.
According to a report by the New York Times, the first step will be to urge the United Nations Security Council to condemn the recent measures taken by North Korea, including its withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the reopening of nuclear facilities that can produce weapon-grade plutonium. The timing may be over the next two weeks.
However, the Pacific allies of the Washington authorities are still opposed to the idea of imposing sanctions on North Korea, and the UN Security Council may still focus on the Iraq issue in the next few weeks.
The New York Times reported that at the same time, many US officials are worried that if the United States launches attacks against Iraq, North Korea may take the opportunity to promote its weapons production.
US troops to conduct training in Philippine Hostage island
(Agence France-Presse, Manila, 17.) US military trainers will be sent to the Philippine hostage island and the island this year to assist the Philippines in responding to the terrorist threat brought about by Muslim rebel groups.
Philippine President Arroyo said, "this training exercise will form part of the defense and security cooperation between the Philippines and the United States as a whole, and will continue to focus on increasing our ability to defend ourselves against the threat of terror."
In a statement, he pointed out: "As for the detailed number of troops and support units of the United States, and the duration of the exercise, it will still be decided by the Philippine government and the United States."
Philippine Defense Minister Reyes told the media that the US general secretary of the United States will arrive in the Philippines in the near future and "discuss the various conditions and details of the operation in the Soviet Union."
Sulu is the islands of the south of the Philippines, including the island of Lu.
Gao Liz, national security advisor to Arroyo, said that the training exercise conducted by the Soviet Union would "give the Philippine armed forces the greatest training in combating terrorism."
Since the terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001, the US government has been stepping up its military assistance to the Philippine government, fearing that al-Qaeda's Muslim militants, who were driven out by the US-led war in Afghanistan, may have set up bases in Southeast Asia.
The above concerns have been supported by the bomb explosion in Bali, Indonesia last year, which killed nearly 200 people.
The majority of those killed in the Bali bombings are tourists from the West.
Reid, founder of the German telecommunications industry, announced that he would go bankrupt.
(Agence France-Presse, Hamburg, 18) - founder and former chairman of the German telecommunications industry MobilCom, who is also former chairman of the company, announced today that his personal bankruptcy was affected by the huge decline in the face value of the stock, and that he had filed an application with the Flensburg court in northern Germany.
He is in possession of about 40 percent of his company's shares. In the past year, the company's financial difficulties were almost on the verge of bankruptcy, affecting the collapse of MobilCom's stock market.
The statement pointed out that Germany's private property and real estate were also affected.
The court has assigned an accountant to deal with his insolvency.
In order to create a new version of the global action communications system for the new generation of mobile phone networks, he spent a lot of money in the long run, resulting in the dismissal of France Telecom, a major shareholder of MobilCom, last year.
In a statement to be issued later today, Mobilcom said that his personal bankruptcy had no effect on the company's business or contract.
The statement also said that there will be no change in the relief package of about 7 billion euros for French telecommunications, which is expected to be funded by the German government and financial institutions.
North Korean army shows North Korea's threat to withdraw from truce in March
(Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 18) - South Korea and the United States are preparing to launch a large-scale military exercise for nearly a month since early March, for which North Korea has threatened to withdraw from the Korean War.
At a time when the tense situation in the Korean Peninsula has persisted for four months, North Korea has threatened to withdraw from the truce agreement. The general interpretation is that this is the response of the Pyongyang authorities to the United States and South Korea's announcement yesterday that a joint military exercise will be held in March.
The statement issued by the North Korean military accused the United States of repeatedly violating the truce agreement. "If the United States continues to arbitrarily violate and misuse the truce agreement, North Korea does not need to continue to abide by the truce agreement.
The future development will depend entirely on the attitude of the US side. "
However, senior US military officials said that as early as 1994, North Korea had said that they would no longer be bound by the Korean War truce agreement.
The US authorities announced yesterday that the United States and South Korea will hold an annual joint military exercise on the Korean Peninsula from March 4 to April 2.
A South Korean government official said that yesterday South Korea had extended an invitation to North Korea to send observers to observe the military exercise.
"North Korea's statement on withdrawal of the truce agreement is obviously a response to the upcoming joint military exercise between South Korea and the United States."
Prior to this, the United States had already ordered 12 B-52 bombers to be deployed to the Korean Peninsula in the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has strongly condemned this.
In addition, Japanese media reported yesterday that the United States has planned to strengthen military deployment in Northeast Asia in order to prevent concerns raised by North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
Indonesian authorities reject US embassy's plan to strengthen security
(Agence France-Presse, Jakarta, 19) - The US embassy in Jakarta proposed to the Indonesian authorities a plan to build a three-meter wall to strengthen the security of the embassy.
The Jakarta Post and the state "Antara" news agency reported today that the Jakarta authorities refused to use the fence to replace the existing fence in which the embassy and the ambassador's residence were separated from the outside world.
The Jakarta official quoted Mayor Susilo as saying that it was possible to build a wall, but the premise was that it had to be built in the embassy district, which is three meters away from the current fence.
At the same time, it is necessary for the embassy to plant flowers in the area between the two barriers, so as to improve the view of the mission area.
Susilo said that the landscape of the garden can reduce the feeling that the US embassy gives people a fortress.
The US Embassy in Indonesia continued to face demonstrations and protests before and after the US-led military operation aimed at overthrowing the Taliban regime in 2001.
At that time, after the former ambassador protested that the Jakarta police were unable to effectively curb the actions of the hard-line Muslim groups that threatened the safety of the Americans, the authorities concerned stepped up security at the embassy.
It is generally expected that large-scale protest activities will not be avoided if the United States forces its military forces against Iraq.

(AFP, Tokyo) Japan's electronics giant Sony Corp. said that since May the new force will launch a broadband connection device at retail outlets in all parts of Japan for retail outlets in all parts of Japan, so as to further push the popular new power game hosts to the Internet world.
By the end of December, until the end of December, until the end of December, new power companies have sold only 190,000 sets of broadband connections.
Broadband connections, made up of hard discs and transfers, are being sold only through the Internet service providers (ISPs).
Compared to Japan's PlayStation 2 users, the number of users is 12.5 million, and the number of users across the globe is as high as 50.4 million, which is out of proportion to the aforementioned sales performance.
New efforts are being made to encourage users to take advantage of the game strategy.
A spokeswoman for the new power Computer Entertainment Company (SCE) said: "We are going to sell links to shops so that more users can enjoy the fun of online games."
The spokesman said that out of the existing 840 PlayStation 2 games, there is only one game on the road, and there will be two more games in the next few months.
Some 20 games sold in Japan are equipped with the capacity to do the same.
The prices of broadband links are not yet available, but they are sold by Internet service providers at a price of 18,000 yen (US $150).
The new forces have sold some 570,000 sets of narrow network links in North America. They are sold at about US $39 each and there are about 20 types of games.
After two years in Asia, we will have the world's largest programming designer population.
(AFP, Singapore) according to a report released today by the international information company, the Asia-Pacific region will have more computer program designers and other professional R & D personnel than North America in the next two years.
North America is the region with the largest concentration of R & D personnel in 2001. It has replaced Europe to become the region with the second largest research and development population in the world.
However, the "International Information" report says that the strong growth of China and India is expected to push the Asia-Pacific region to the highest level in 2005.
The Asian region, especially India, is a major source of professionals in the information industry in North America.
"International Information" says: "in the next five years, the growth of the Asia-Pacific region is expected to be much stronger than that of North America, especially those big countries, China and India."
According to international information, there were 7.8 million researchers in 2001. This figure is expected to increase to 13.3 million in 2006.
The report points out that at the end of 2001, there were 1.7 million information industry researchers in Asia.
"International Information" indicates that there has been a decline in the number of information professionals in North America, partly due to the decline in the technology industry in the region.
Study shows that a father's gene may affect the birth of a child
(AFP, Paris, 28) according to a Danish study published by the British medical weekly, which will be published on Saturday, the father's genes may affect the time of the child's birth.
About five percent of pregnant women will be born late, that is, 94 days of pregnancy.
It is now known that the problem will cause health problems for mothers and children, but the cause of the problem is still a mystery.
During the period from 1980 to 1992, Danish researchers tracked a total of 43 000 births, including at least two children, and the first time when they were pregnant.
At the time of the analysis, only the two previous production materials were used.
As a whole, nearly 20 per cent of these first pregnant women experienced the same experience when they were pregnant for the second time.
However, when the first and second children came from different fathers, the ratio fell to just over 15 per cent.
The chief editor of the study told AFP, "this is already a lot.
This means that if your partner in the second child is the same, then the possibility that you have a long period of pregnancy is 30% higher than that of a person who changes a partner. "
The study said: "If a woman changes his partner every time she is pregnant, it will be able to reduce the risk of recurrence.
We believe that this is a new discovery.
This result means that the time of birth may be determined by the father's gene. "

US Defense Department cancelled two missile interception tests
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) The United States has decided to cancel the two missile interception tests scheduled for the first half of this year.
Lesner told the press here that the missile defense agency will need to concentrate its efforts this year on solving the problem of promoting rockets. The next missile interception test will be carried out after the Boeing company produces a new type of propulsion rocket in the autumn of this year.
The Boeing company originally planned to launch a flight test on a new type of launch vehicle to carry missile "interception devices" in the year 2000. However, it was postponed due to technical reasons.
After the failure of the rocket launch in December 2001, Boeing decided to reopen the design and is scheduled to be completed in the fall of this year.
In the eight land-based missile interception tests carried out, the US military used the modified "militia" rocket as an alternative boosters, but the test effect of this boosters has not been satisfactory.
The missile interception tests carried out in July 2000 and in December last year failed because the "interception device" could not be separated from the propulsion rocket.
On 17 December last year, US President Bush ordered the Ministry of Defense to proceed with the deployment of a missile defense system, with a view to establishing a preliminary missile defense system by September 2004.
However, many experts believe that, technically speaking, the time is not yet ripe for the deployment of the missile defense system.
Kadish, director of the Missile Defense Agency, also said that if Boeing cannot produce qualified support rockets as scheduled, the deployment of the entire missile defense system will be affected.

EU finds a huge diamond trade violation of monopoly law
BRUSSELS, January 16 (Xinhua) The European Union (EU) today announced that the European Union (EU), the largest diamond supplier in the world, is in violation of the EU's anti-monopoly law.
De Beers, which owns the company's headquarters in South Africa and the United Kingdom, controls 60 to 65 per cent of the world's rough diamonds, while the Russian diamond company is the only diamond mining company in Russia and the second largest producer of rough diamonds in the world.
According to the huge contract signed by the two companies for a period of five years, the Russian diamond company agreed to make one half of the annual production of diamonds, that is, rough diamonds worth about 800 million euros, to De Beers, which would then be responsible for bringing these diamonds to the market.

According to the EU's anti-monopoly law, these two companies can object to the decision of the European Commission within two months. The European Commission will also continue its antitrust investigation of these two companies.

Riyadh, January 22 (Xinhua) The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will not be able to make up for the 5 million barrels of crude oil in the international market.
Al-Khalil said that among the OPEC members, only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have actually increased their production capacity.
"OPEC has problems in meeting market demand, because Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates can increase production by up to 3 million barrels per day," he said.
Since December of last year, the price of crude oil in the international market has continued to rise as a result of the nationwide strike in Venezuela and the threat of the Iraqi war.
OPEC decided on the 12th in Vienna to increase the daily production of crude oil by 1.5 million barrels since February.
But because the threat of war in Iraq has not been eliminated, and Britain and the United States continue to send more troops to the Gulf region, the oil price in the international market continued to rise on the 21st.
Khalil said that compared to the relationship between supply and demand, international oil prices are currently affected by the tension in the international political situation.
Shenzhen Lo Wu Customs crack down on currency smuggling
Shenzhen, January 25 (Xinhua) at the same time, the Customs and Excise Department of the People's Republic of China (Lo Wu) has taken strict measures to crack down on the smuggling of currency.
Last year, a total of 1,023 currency cases were seized, amounting to more than 1.5 billion yuan of Renminbi, of which 15 cases (excluding foreign exchange bills) were worth more than half a million yuan.
As the largest travel control point in the country, the Lo Wu Customs has the task of monitoring more than 250,000 passenger trips a day. It is likely that there will be a sizeable currency outflow every day for the more prevalent Super currency phenomenon, such as the lack of strict control.

On the morning of 19 February last year, at 9: 00 a.m., a middle-aged woman, who was carrying a suitcase and made a rapid response, attracted the attention of customs officials.
After the luggage was over, the customs officer discovered that there was a suspicious object inside the suitcase, which was found to be in the case of a black plastic bag containing a total of 3 million HK dollars, a total of 3 million Hong Kong dollars.
This was the largest of the cases in the last two years.
In July and August last year, the "underground money Zhuang" attempted to use the Lo Wu control point to take advantage of the heavy traffic flow at the Lo Wu control point.
It attaches great importance to this and has focused on deploying manpower at the site to resolutely crack down on the smuggling of foreign currencies by "underground money houses."
From 2 July to 1 August, the Lo Wu Customs seized a total of four cases involving the smuggling of foreign currencies, with a total value of more than 146 million yuan.

The company is expected to increase its turnover by 5 percent during the Spring Festival.
In order to meet the needs of the mainland visitors, some companies have begun to change their mode of operation and tactics. Many companies have stepped up training for their staff to learn Putonghua.
The old company usually does not offer shopping discounts. However, as long as mainland visitors pay cash, there will be concessions to attract more mainland customers.

(international) Nicaragua holds rallies to oppose US war against Iraq
MANAGUA, January 30 (Xinhua) several hundred anti-war activists held a demonstration in front of the US embassy in Nicaragua Thursday to protest against possible military strikes by the United States against Iraq.

(international) the growth of personal consumption expenditure in the United States last year was not good.
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) The U S Department of Commerce reported today that although personal consumption in the United States showed a relatively rapid growth in December last year, the annual growth rate was only the same as in 2001, when the economy was in recession.
In the last month of last year, the main driving force for economic growth in the United States grew by 0.9%, the largest increase since July last year.
Expenditure on consumer durable goods increased by 6.1 per cent, while expenditure on non-durable goods and services grew by only 0.2 per cent.
This is a clear sign of the low peak consumption season in the United States.
In the last quarter of last year, the expenditure on personal consumption, which accounted for about two thirds of the United States gross domestic product (GDP), grew by only 1 percent, significantly lower than the 4.2% growth in the third quarter, the smallest increase since the first quarter of 1993.
Economic analysts believe that this is mainly due to the possibility that the US may launch a war against Iraq, a slump in the stock market, and a weakening of the job market. This has also become the most important reason for the rapid slowdown in the fourth quarter of the US economy.
In the whole of last year, personal consumption expenditure in the United States grew by 4.5%, which is the same as the increase in 2001.
The report also showed that personal income in the United States increased by 0.4% in December last year.
The increase in personal income in the United States last year was 3%, lower than the 3.3% increase in 2001.
As consumer spending grew faster than income growth, the American savings rate fell from 4.5 per cent in November to 4.1 per cent at the end of the year.
(international) attacks on French army in Cote d'Ivoire
ABIDJAN, January 31 (Xinhua) French soldiers stationed in c魌e d'Ivoire were attacked by local protesters at Abidjan airport on 31 January. Some 800 young Ivorian youths threw stones at the soldiers of the French army, causing serious injuries to one of the French soldiers.
Since the resumption of talks between the leaders of West African countries in Senegal on the civil war in c魌e d'Ivoire, the chaotic situation in c魌e d'Ivoire has escalated.
The new prime minister was nominated as the new prime minister in the political arena of c魌e d'Ivoire, and will return to the country on 31 March to set up a coalition government.
However, the "Youth patriot" organization, which supports the president of c魌e d'Ivoire, is not satisfied with the important positions of the rebel armed representatives in the future government, such as defense and the interior.
They accused France of using Barbo to accept the formation of the government, saying that Diyala is a "French Prime Minister," and that he was waiting for the death of Diyala.
According to reports, although the runway at Abidjan airport has been cleaned up, hundreds of members of the "Youth patriot" still remain in the waiting hall and are prepared to boycott Diyala to return to their country.
The civil war in c魌e d'Ivoire has lasted for four months and hundreds of people have lost their lives in the conflict.
On 31 March, the French Foreign Ministry proposed that 16,000 French nationals in c魌e d'Ivoire should withdraw as soon as possible.
(international) the launch of two Canadian astronauts will be frustrated.
OTTAWA, February 3 (Xinhua) two Canadian astronauts were hit by the US space shuttle in May and November this year, according to local media reports today.
Canadian Space Agency director and Canada's first astronaut, garino, said that the US investigation into the "Colombia" incident may hinder the tasks set by the international space station, and some plans may be postponed or even cancelled.
Canadian astronaut Mclin and Williams are scheduled to be launched in May and November this year, respectively.
Both of them are currently undergoing training in Houston, United States.
In the 1990s, three astronauts from Canada participated in space missions by the space shuttle Columbia in the 1990s.
Garino also revealed that two scientific researches sponsored by Canada were included in the space science experiment carried by the "Colombia" on this occasion.
One of the purposes of these studies is the growth of protein crystal, one of the purposes of which is to provide for the treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer.
According to other reports, after the crash of Columbia, NASA immediately shortened an astronaut training activity in Canada.
Seven astronauts were trained to return to the United States last week at the walkaczech military base near the city of Quebec, Canada.
(international) US construction expenditure rises sharply in December last year
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) U S construction spending increased by 1.2 percent in December last year, according to a report released today by the U S Department of Commerce.
According to the report, in December last year, expenditure on housing construction was on a seasonally adjusted basis at an annual rate of $43.6 billion, an increase of 2.9% over November.
Analysts believe that low interest rates are an important factor contributing to the strong growth of housing construction.
At present, the US Federal Reserve continues to stabilize the short-term interest rate at 1.2%, the lowest level in the past 41 years.
However, in contrast to the housing construction situation, US commercial construction expenditure in December last year was adjusted on a seasonally adjusted basis, at an annual rate of $158.6 billion, a 1.9% drop from November.
Analysts believe that, at present, there are unstable factors in the US economic prospects, and enterprises are unwilling to increase investment in the construction of factories and other facilities.
In addition, the fear of terrorist attacks also had a negative impact on commercial construction activities. Although Bush signed the terrorist insurance bill last November, it was not enough to dispel the concerns of investors.
In the whole year of last year, the growth rate of domestic construction expenditure in the United States fell from 2.7 per cent in 2001 to 0.4 per cent, the lowest level since 1991.

(international) study found that early childhood learning barriers can be overcome
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) early born babies with low weight are likely to encounter difficulties in learning.
Researchers at Yale University in the United States recently discovered that with age growth, this learning obstacle can be overcome.
The study confirmed that the nervous system of premature births of less than 1,500 grams is prone to problems, with as many as 50 per cent of the children in need of special assistance when they go to school.
Although many experiments have shown that animals can recover from early brain damage, they have never seen any relevant reports about the resumption of brain damage.
According to local media reports, Yale University researchers have followed up on 300 premature births and conducted an IQ test at the age of 3, 4, 6, 6 and 8.
The test said that at the age of three, premature births were classified as "mental barriers". Half of the five years later, half of them reached the general level in the language understanding and IQ test.
However, 23 per cent of infants still suffer from severe brain damage due to cerebral hemorrhage, and there has been no improvement in intellectual development.
Researchers say that a key factor in the intellectual development of premature births is the family environment.
There are relatively high IQ tests for children from three homes and mothers who have received higher education.

(international) EU suspended imports of Paraguay's beef
Buenos Aires, February 20 (Xinhua) The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock of Paraguay announced today that it has decided to suspend imports of Paraguayan beef because of the problem of foot and mouth disease in Paraguay.
According to a report by the Paraguayan media, Paraguay's minister of agriculture and animal husbandry announced that the EU had made the above decision at a meeting held on the 19th.
According to a report submitted by the inspection team of the European Commission's food and veterinary office in early February, the measures taken by Paraguay to control foot and mouth disease are still inadequate, and there is a "serious problem" in the control and inspection system for foot and mouth disease, which does not meet the EU's requirements in terms of health control, professional skill level, or export certification system.
Paraguay was the first case of foot and mouth disease in October last year, followed by epidemic prevention and control measures with the help of other members of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur).
Paraguay exports about 60,000 tons of beef annually, mainly to countries such as Brazil and Chile.
These countries have suspended the import of Paraguayan beef.
From January to October last year, the EU imported 567 tons of beef from Paraguay.
(international) Austrian researchers find polio cells causing chronic pain
VIENNA, February 20 (Xinhua) The research staff of the University of Vienna in Vienna today found a group of nerve cells with enduring memory. These cells will be very excited, and this is a step forward in the search for the cause of chronic pain.
The chronically ill patients are extremely sensitive to pain and have to live with pain in their daily lives.
But so far people have almost no knowledge of the causes of the illness.
According to a DPA report, the research team, led by the head of the Department of neuroscience at the University of Vienna, who was led by the head of the Department of neurological science at the University of Vienna, found that certain polio cells were not unusual in normal circumstances and were excited by pain.
The pain has been strong, and the response has been enhanced.
However, unlike other nerve cells, this group of polio has become too sensitive to pain stimulation, even if it is only marginally stimulated by pain.
The researchers also found that there is also a special channel in the polio cell. When the cells are stimulated, they will be opened up, and there will be an influx of calcium ions, thus further triggering a chain reaction.
It is believed that the chronic pain suffered by patients with chronic pain is due to the fact that the nerve cells in the polio have a lasting memory and retain the "pain of pain".
He indicated that the discovery could lead people to look for ways to eliminate such memories.
Consumer prices in China rise in January
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) China's consumer prices rose by 0.4 percent in January compared with the same month last year, the National Statistics Bureau reported today.
The National Bureau of Statistics says that the main reason for the increase in the overall consumer price is that this year's Spring Festival is at the end of January, and that during the Spring Festival in February last year, the peak period of consumption was different, so there was a certain difference.
Another reason is that the weather this year is more cold than last year.
Among the 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions surveyed by China, 22 residents' total consumer price levels have risen compared to the same period last year, while the remaining seven have declined over the same period.
Statistics show that among the various types of consumer goods, the prices of seasonal consumer goods and services such as fresh vegetables, fruits, and cultural entertainment have risen, while the prices of food, clothing, consumer durable goods and so on are falling.
The increase in petrol and diesel prices has led to a rise in the price of liquefied petroleum gas, which continues to rise in residential prices.

(international) Brazil's national risk index drops
BRASILIA, February 27 (Xinhua) Brazil's national risk index fell to 1,191 today, a drop of 2.37 percent over the previous day.
This is the first time since the outbreak of financial turmoil in Brazil in June last year that the index fell below 1,200 points for the first time in eight months.
At the same time, Brazil's bonds on international markets rose by 0.42 percent on the same day, reaching 74 percent of the face value.
This is also the best record for eight months.
The national risk index is closely related to the price of the bonds. The higher the index, the lower the price of the bonds.
Last year, the national risk index of Brazil exceeded 2,400 points, and bond prices fell to 48 percent of the face value.
Brazil's national risk index has continued to decline since the new government took office this year.
Recently, foreign investors believe that the price of Brazilian bonds is cheap and the rate of return is high. As a result, there has been a sharp increase in demand, which has led to a drop in the national risk index in Brazil.
However, analysts pointed out that even though international investors are optimistic about Brazilian bonds, if the US-Iraq war breaks out, foreign investment will decrease, and the National risk index is likely to rise again. At the same time, the price of bonds is again falling.
