Theft of two portable computers containing information on the cause of death of Princess Diana
AFP, London, June 6 (Xinhua)
The London Daily Express pointed out that two notebook computers documenting the death of Princess Diana's death accident in Paris in 1997 were stolen from the Office of the former Metropolitan police chief.
The report points out that the theft has given rise to speculation that the computer may contain confidential information about the investigation conducted by the former Metropolitan police chief, Sir Stephen Steve.
However, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said that the computer did not have any sensitive information or information relating to the investigation.
Sir Stephen is the director of the norsanja police station in the United Kingdom, and his office is located in the area of the New Castle of Thailand.
The report claimed that there were two cases of theft in the last 10 days.
Together, the weekend holidays from January 28 to 29, including computers and cash, were taken away; the second one took place last week and there was no loss.
The norsanja police station also indicated that there was no evidence to show that the two cases were related to the work of Sir Steve.
Stephen has been tracing the cause of death of the Princess of Wales not as a direct result of a car accident.
The Royal autopsy was ordered in 2004 to continue the investigation of the relevant evidence.
She was killed in a car accident in a Paris tunnel on August 31, 1997.
After two years of investigation, the French police believed that it was due to the driver's drunk driving and the use of medicine, which caused the car to lose control and lead to tragedy.
Warring parties in Sri Lanka agree to negotiate in Geneva later this month
Agence France-Presse, May 7 (Xinhua)
Norway, which is an intermediary in the peace process, said that the warring groups in Sri Lanka had agreed to start negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, on the 22nd of this month, in order to resolve the stalemate in the negotiations which had been stalled for three years in the search for an end to the bloody conflict that had lasted for several decades.
This breakthrough was achieved following a meeting between Norway's special envoy for peace, Solheim, in London with the negotiating representative of the Liberation Tigers of Tanzania.
The Norwegian embassy here said in a statement that "the conflict in Sri Lanka, that is, the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tanzania, has requested the government of Norway to assist in the talks to be held in Geneva on February 22 and 23."
The two-day talks will focus on how to strengthen the ceasefire agreement which came into force on 23 February 2002; this agreement has not been fully respected by both parties.
The Norwegian embassy said: "The two sides will discuss how to improve the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. This is also the first time in three years that the two sides have held face-to-face talks at such a high level."
Solheim said that he would lead the Norwegian team to take part in the talks, and that the four representatives of the tanmiran Liberation Tigers were headed by barsinkhan, while the government of Sri Lanka was led by the Minister of Health.
He said: "This is a small but important step on the road to peace.
The previous round of negotiations for the settlement of the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka was held in Japan in March 2003. However, the tiger's Liberation Tigers had cancelled the seventh round of talks scheduled to be held in Thailand in April 2003.

Agence France-Presse, Italy
At the opening ceremony of the 20th Winter Olympics today in Du Lin, South Korea and North Korea, which were enemies of each other during the Cold War, joined hands with each other in the entry ceremony.
In South Korea, the South Korean women and the North Korean team led the South and North Korean teams into the Winter Olympic Games.
This is the first time that the South Korean and North Korean Olympic teams have joined hands in the Winter Olympics.
In order to reflect the unity of reconciliation between the two sides in recent years, both the South Korean and North Korean teams took part in the Sydney Summer Olympics in 2000 and the Athens Summer Olympics in 2004.
North Korea did not participate in the 19th Winter Olympics at Salt Lake City in the United States.
In 1948, the Korean Peninsula split into a capitalist South Korea and a communist North Korea. The two sides were hostile to each other during the Korean War between 1950 and 1953.
After the leaders of South and North Korea held a peace summit in 2000, the relations between the two sides improved.
According to tradition, the Greek team is the first country to be admitted. Of the 80 countries participating in the competition, South Korea is the 22nd and the 23rd country in North Korea.
The Italian team was the last country to be admitted. When the volunteer team came in, a warm and warm applause broke out in the stadium.
Hoffman, who has been fascinated by drugs, promptly woke up to create a career for the Performing Arts.
AFP, New York, January 16 (Xinhua)
It was recognized that he was most likely to win this year's Oscar emperor, a male lead in the film "Ko Po". He revealed that he had been unable to get rid of drugs and alcohol when he was young. Fortunately, he was successful in his career.
In an interview with the American Broadcasting Company news magazine "60 Minutes", Hoffmann said that in order to get drugs and wine, it was really unscrupulous.
At that time, he had just graduated from the University of New York and had just graduated from the University of New York.
He entered the rehabilitation center at the age of 22, where he dropped the habit of drinking alcohol and medicine, which was the worst of his life.
At the Oscar awards ceremony to be held next month, Hoffmann interpreted the film "The imperial emperor: a cold spell", which is believed to be most promising to win the best male lead award.
Prior to this, his skilful acting had long been affirmed. He had already received a number of awards, including a Golden Globe Award, the best male lead.
The 38-year-old performer said during the interview that if he did not have the determination to change his bad habit before becoming famous, he might not have been nominated by the Oscar.
He said that he was very jealous of those beautiful actors who, at the age of 19, suddenly became famous and had a lot of gold.
Outbreak of bird flu in Europe
Agence France-Presse, Brussels, 16
The outbreak of the avian flu virus continues to emerge in Europe, causing anxiety among the people.
The Executive Committee of the European Union (EU) has approved the establishment of a further "buffer zone" to control the entire region of the country where the virus was found, and to ban the transportation of all poultry birds.
On the eighth day after the discovery of the deadly H5N1 virus in Africa, the epidemic continued to spread to more poultry farms, and there were signs that it had crossed the northern border to the country.
Egyptian officials are investigating the sudden death of chickens at a chicken farm in the south. They are worried that the virus may continue to spread.
The chicken market in Europe was affected by the virus incident. The EU executive committee stressed that there was no reason for panic.
Ji Puno, executive director of the executive committee on health and food safety, said that the public's concern about the matter is understandable, but there is no need for an excessive response.
Following the discovery of the three kilometers of protected areas and the 10-kilometre restricted zone in the vicinity of the virus, the EU executive committee also passed a new regulation to list all the European areas where the virus was discovered as a "buffer zone."
A EU official who wished to remain anonymous said that everyone was nervous. They were handling the news from various parts of Europe all day long, and they suspected that the epidemic had already broken out.
The European region has so far witnessed the emergence of the H5N1 virus in Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and Russia in the territory of Europe. Almost all of them have been found on the wild swans.
Romania found its 31st case on the 16th, and new cases were found on the island of rugenia, Austria, Greece and Germany.
In southern Italy, the bird flu virus was found on two ducks. It was the first wild swans in Europe to be infected with the H5N1 virus.
What the EU officials are most worried about now is the migratory birds that are about to return from Africa.
The government is stepping up its efforts to prevent the transmission of the virus to human beings on the African continent.
The national government announced that all bird birds in a radius of five kilometres in the vicinity of infected farms were destroyed, regardless of whether they were threatened by the virus or not.
The neighbouring national government announced that the country had entered a state of alert and made an emergency plan of 4 million US dollars to monitor the border with Nigeria.
The newly established National Emergency Committee said that they have been informed that nearly 400 avian birds have died in the loose border between the two countries.
Next, let's focus on the Iranian nuclear issue.
The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed on the 6th that the Iranian government has sent a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency requesting that all equipment for monitoring Iranian nuclear facilities be removed by the middle of this month.
Since the International Atomic Energy Agency decided to report the Iranian nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, Iran has announced that it will terminate all support and cooperation measures on the nuclear issue and will no longer allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct surprise inspections of its nuclear facilities.
Regarding the current tense situation on the Iranian nuclear issue, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said in Athens, Greece, on the 6th that cooperation between Russia and Iran still exists.
This will be the driving force for resolving the Iranian nuclear issue.
A spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Russia's proposal to establish uranium enrichment joint enterprises in Russia is still valid.
The two sides may hold consultations next week on this issue.
On the same day, Lu Ge, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said at UN headquarters in New York that the United States does not support Israel's attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities.
According to a recent report, Israel's defense experts said that, if necessary, the Israeli air force could damage Iran's nuclear facilities.
Xinhua News Agency reports that Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Kiseljak said on the 7th that Russia is willing to cooperate with Iran on the nuclear issue so as to help Iran obtain its legal power to develop nuclear energy peacefully.
Kiseljak said that the proposal put forward by Russia with Iran's uranium enrichment joint enterprise is still valid.
Russia hopes to hold consultations with Iran on this issue in the near future.
At the end of December of last year, Russia submitted to Iran a proposal for the two countries to establish uranium enrichment joint enterprises in Russia.
Both the European Union and the United States have indicated that they can accept this compromise proposal.
However, Iran hopes that Russia will continue to revise the original plan.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said on the 7th that although the International Atomic Energy Agency reported the Iran nuclear energy issue to the UN Security Council, it did not transfer the agency's responsibility to deal with the Iranian nuclear issue to the Security Council.
Therefore, the various parties still need to break the deadlock in the Iranian nuclear issue within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency resolution, IAEA Director General ElBaradei will submit a report on the Iranian nuclear issue to the Security Council in March.
The council will make a final decision after making an assessment of the report.
We consider such a resolution to call on the Iranian side to comply with the relevant resolutions of the Council and the commitments it has made, and not to refer the matter to the council or to the council.
Recently, China has been seeking a peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomatic channels.
Kong Quan said that on February 1, Zhang Yan, director of the Department of Arms Control and Disarmament of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, held talks with Iran's chief security committee secretary Larijani in Tehran on the Iranian nuclear issue.
China hopes that Iran should attach importance to the key of the international community and create conditions for the peaceful settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.
Resolving the Iran nuclear issue within the International Atomic Energy framework is not only in the interest of the Chinese side, but we also believe that it is in the interests of all parties concerned.
To this end, we again appeal to the parties concerned in the international community not to abandon the diplomatic efforts made on this issue.
Hamas, which is currently setting up a new Palestinian autonomous government, officially announced that in addition to the candidate for the prime minister, the cabinet list of the new government has been basically completed.
This has led to outside speculation about the candidate for the prime minister.
On the 8th, a senior Hamas official disclosed to Associated Press that Hamas is preparing to nominate chairman of the board of directors of the Islamic University of Gaza ((Businessman)) Hu generations to be the prime minister of the new autonomous government, but the nomination has not been formally submitted to Abbas.
Hu daili, aged 50, with the support of Hamas, participated in the Palestinian legislative elections held last month as an independent candidate.
There has never been any mention of violence or opposition to Israel in public speeches.
But he once said that there is a need for reform within Palestine.
A senior Hamas delegation is currently on a visit to Cairo to discuss with Egypt the issue of the formation of a new Palestinian government by Hamas.
Kazakhstan, one of the members of the delegation, told the press on the 8th: Although the international community and some Arab countries have been exerting pressure, the Palestinian government formed by the Hamas leadership will not recognize Israel.
At the same time, Ma Shaul also warned Abbas in his speech: We should not arbitrarily change the structure of the Palestinian leadership without prior consultation with Hamas.
Analysts believe this is a response to Abbas's intention to appoint Interior Minister Yusuf as deputy commander of the security forces.
On the issue of setting up a new Palestinian autonomous government, Ma shale refused to confirm that Hamas was preparing to nominate the chairman of the board of directors of the Islamic University of Gaza ((Businessman)) Hu Jintao to be the prime minister of the government.
He said: The candidate for the prime minister has not yet been decided.
Before he reiterated his refusal to recognize Israel, another political leader of Hamas, Marzuk, said in an interview with Egyptian Television that Hamas will never recognize Israel's legal status, but the new government will continue to make contacts with Israel in all fields.
Leaving aside the new animosity between the three Hamas candidates and Israel, the territorial issue has always been a difficult issue for Palestine and Israel.
On the 7th, Israeli Acting Prime Minister Olmert said in an interview with Israeli TV station II that Israel must be separated from Palestine by designating a permanent border.
This means that Israel will have to withdraw from parts of the west bank of the Jordan River.
However, Olmert emphasized that Israel will continue to control large Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Jordan Valley region and maintain the integrity of Jerusalem.

At the same time, we used the shortest time in the country to verify the identity of the dead.
Chen Jian said that the Ministry of Commerce will pay close attention to the handling of the incident and will actively coordinate relevant units to deal with the aftermath of the accident.
If security is not ensured for the time being, we will ask Chinese enterprises to stop.

The project was launched in 2004.
The Hefei cement industrial design institute is responsible for providing a complete set of equipment and technical services for the plant, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2006.
The remains of the three Chinese engineers who died in attacks in Pakistan were shipped back to their country from Karachi at 7: 00 a.m. local time.
Let's take a look at a report sent back by our reporter Tao Ye from Pakistan.

Hello Tao Ye.
Ah, Hello, (())
Yes.
At the meeting just now,

What are the progress of the investigations that were introduced at the meeting just now?
Ah, okay.
Just as you said, just an hour ago, the province of Balochistan, Pakistan, was the police director of the province where the incident occurred. The person named Yakubu came to the Consulate General of Pakistan in Karachi and briefed me on the investigation of the incident by the Pakistani police over the past two days.
In his briefing, he gave a brief account of the clues and goals currently used by the Pakistani police, Er, to track down the murderers.
Er, they believe that this matter should be done by outsiders, but it will definitely have links with some local residents.

Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen held a press conference at the Prime Minister's Office on Tuesday.
He said: The fact that the founder of Islam, Mohammed cartoon, has developed to the present state of affairs is being exploited by extremists.
He ((said)): Denmark respects all beliefs and calls for everyone to have the same rights. Er, at the same time, he appealed to Muslims to exercise restraint and not to resort to violence.
At 4: 30 p.m. on the 7th, a press conference was held between Prime Minister Rasmussen, prime minister of the prime minister of Denmark, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Rasmussen said.
The violence that took place in the embassies of several European countries is not just a matter between the Muslim countries and Denmark.
It is very important for the government of Denmark and the people of Denmark to gain the support of a broad international community.
We are with the French Union.
In other European countries, the United States is working closely with some of the organizations of the Muslim countries.
Just a few minutes ago, US President Bush called.
In the telephone, he expressed his support for Denmark and was in line with Denmark.
Rasmussen said: We also believe that it is through dialogue and tolerance to resolve the problem rather than violence.
We emphasize freedom and democracy, and respect for faith is a valuable value.
Today I appeal to the people of all Muslim countries to work together to calm the spread of violence.
We need to resolve incidents rather than violence through dialogue.
Today we are facing an enlarged international situation.
We witnessed the burning of the Danish flag and the destruction of the embassy.
We see that the people of Denmark are considered not to be tolerated and are considered to be the enemies of Islam.
This is wrong.
Extremist and radical elements are using cultural conflicts to expand the state of affairs.
Rasmussen stressed: The people of Denmark and Denmark are not the enemies of Islam and other religions.
How many generations of people go beyond the political pursuit of human rights, democracy and freedom.
We continue to fight for it.
This is part of Denmark's history and a basic part of Danish society.
Denmark is one of the most tolerant countries in the world.
We respect all beliefs.
We stop the violence.
We believe that everyone has the same rights.
New Tang Dynasty television reporter Li Lo and Dane reported from Copenhagen, Denmark.
Iranian extremists who were dissatisfied with the publication of the Mohammed cartoon again attacked the Danish embassy in Tehran on Tuesday and threw a petrol bomb.
At the same time, a state newspaper in Iran organized the Nazi massacre of Jews in retaliation for reprisals.
The United States denounced this as an opportunity to strengthen Iranian President Ahmadinejad's consistent anti-Israeli arrogance.
About 20 to 30 protesters climbed over the wall to enter the embassy of the Danish embassy in Iran.
As many as 300 people threw stones and petrol bombs outside the building.
The day before, members of the Iranian hard-line militia group led hundreds of demonstrators to attack the Danish and Austrian embassies in Tehran.
The comic book which triggered the controversy was first published by the Japanese rand post in September of last year.
Other European countries and three Arab newspapers have also been reprinted.
In retaliation, the most widely distributed newspaper Citizen of Iran recently announced the holding of a cartoon competition depicting the massacre of Jews in Nazi Germany.
This move was denounced by the United States and other countries.
The United States Department of State spokesman McCormick said that he believes the practice of Iran's best-selling newspaper has been aimed at reinforcing the malicious remarks of Iranian President amadanga against Israel.
He reiterated that the United States supports freedom of speech in all parts of the world, including Iran.
However, he believes that the publication of a cartoon competition by citizens and the publication of Mohammed comics by the Danish media are two different things.
McCormick said: I don't think anyone will compare Iran's press freedom with the freedom of the press in Western Europe and the United States.
He said that the Holocaust was fictitious and called for Israel to be wiped off the map, which has led to widespread criticism from the United States and other countries.
McCormick believes that the citizens' newspaper was published at the expense of the conservative German city government.
This is by no means a coincidence.
Since high wisdom lawyers launched a 24-hour hunger strike in ten cities across the country on February 14, in response to persecution by the Chinese Communist Party, 170 people in Shanghai recently signed a collective signature, expressing their willingness to participate in this hunger strike.
They also indicated that they would continue to announce the signatures and numbers of the second group of participants.
Next, let's take a look at a report by our station.
It has been learned that the housing prices in Shanghai, under the intention of the government, are among the top few in the world.
Many government units have sought to compel the demolition of houses with high prices and not to pay reasonable compensation.
These people, who have been forced to be demolished and who have lost their homes, are immediately unable to rely on their income.
Children cannot afford school fees and dare not go to school.
For many years, the vast majority of people have won the detention period because of petitioning.
According to statistics, the number of petitioners in Shanghai is the largest in China.
Han Zhongming originally owned a shop, but was forced to sell his own house.
He was placed under house arrest or even detained by the authorities because of petitioning.
He protested in the form of jumping from a building and cutting off his legs until recently.
Chen enjuan's shop was also torn down by the government.
The government employed an outlaw to remove a family of three out of the House and remove the house together with the furniture.
Because of petitioning, she was imprisoned for nearly two years.
Chen enjuan talked about this campaign of solidarity, which is not only a protest against the government's acts of harassment.
The lawyer has given us a lot of help in the law, and he has been very selfless in helping us.
What we want to do now is to ask for democracy, because we also consider the next generation.
Our older generation is already suffering from hardship. We are also fighting for the next generation not to be persecuted. Therefore, we must take part in those protection activities and we cannot give up.
According to the report of the Centre for the right to housing and the demolition of the Human Rights Organization in Geneva, China has been listed as one of the most serious violations of the right to housing in the world.
New Tang Dynasty television reporter Wang Xin, special correspondent Wang Qing, reporting from an interview.
On February 15, many Democrats and ordinary people in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, Canada, and the United States continued to express their support and solidarity in various forms.
The following is a summary report by our reporter.
Mr. Gao Zhiyuan initiated a 24-hour hunger strike in ten provinces and cities throughout China on February 14 in protest against the CCP's tyranny. He once launched a signature drive on the streets of Hong Kong.
Leung Kwok-hung, a member of the Legislative Council who supports Gao Zhiyuan's hunger strike, said that the recent mass arrest of people in defense of rights by the Chinese Communist authorities has already become a very dangerous signal that the regime has absolutely no basis for public opinion.
On the same day, Mr Albert Ho, a member of the Legislative Council who is in the process of preparing for the establishment of the rights concern group, has the turn to go on a hunger strike for one day every week.
He said that on the day of this week, he would introduce to the outside world a lawyer in defense of domestic rights.
At the same time, he is certain that this kind of protection campaign will continue.
On February 13, the epoch times staff and Falun Gong practitioners of Calgary, Canada, held a joint press conference in front of the Chinese consulate. They appealed to the Canadian government and all righteous people at home and abroad to pay attention to and express their support for China's rights to defend their rights.
This is the Metro Plaza in Taipei, which is located in the city of Taipei.
The global relay hunger strike, launched by the epoch times, entered its second day.
People from all walks of life in Taiwan also joined.
Members of the Legislative Council, Mr Michael Tien, also came to the scene to join the hunger strike.
Tian Qiuyi today expressed his solidarity with the hunger strike 24 hours a day.
"The people of a peaceful, more democratic and more free world should show solidarity in this matter."
She said,
Five non-governmental organizations, including Taiwan's southern society and the Kaohsiung medical community, issued a statement a few days ago, saying that Taiwan should have a comprehensive voice and condemn the violent tendency of the Chinese communists in dealing with those who defend their rights.
Professor Yang wei-che of the Department of Mathematics of Taiwan University said:
"This is very important.
This will definitely create a power, Oh.

On 17 February, the Indian border militia strengthened its patrolling of the Nepalese border.
Three battalions have been added as a result of fears that more and more violent Maoist rebels may have infiltrated the border in recent months and are responsible for guarding the border forces of the 200-kilometre India / Nepal border.
The northern part of Nepal is the Himalayas.
The other three sides are adjacent to India, with a total of 1,477 kilometres of border.
The Maoist rebels have frequently infiltrated the Indian border villages and obtained weapons from local gangs and drug traffickers.
According to the deputy inspector general of the randane district border forces, they will be increased from the existing 26 battalions to 36 camps in order to patrol the 100-kilometre boundary line between Tai Chi Ling County and sisijin.
According to Saudi Arabia, it has been reported that the Kambia Liberation Organization in India and the Maoist rebels in the eastern part of Nepal and in the Ilam County have been linked to one another.
The border forces will establish 18 border observation posts to further strengthen the security of the border.
Trained police dogs will accompany the border forces in the detection of explosives and drugs.
The border officials have also begun a thorough examination of all vehicles and people passing through sensitive border checkpoints.
India is concerned that these people may be allied with radical leftist elements in India.
Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world.
The rebels' rebellion undermined the economy of the country as a whole and forced tens of thousands of residents to flee their homes.
On Friday, the Japanese cabinet government released information on the gross domestic product for the fourth quarter of 2005.
As a result of the price adjustment, there was an increase of 1.4 per cent in real terms over the previous quarter, representing an increase of more than 1.2 per cent in real terms over the previous quarter.
The main reason was the strong domestic demand and the growth of exports to major countries, such as China and the United States, which showed signs of sustained economic recovery.
This is the fourth consecutive quarter economic growth in Japan, and it is the largest increase since the first to third quarter of 2005. It is mainly due to personal expenses, capital expenditure, and healthy exports.
In addition, the Central Bank of Japan will also end its five years of extremely lax monetary policy in April, which has contributed to the expectations of the financial market for the economic boom.
Between October and December, private consumption increased by 0.8% in the face of an improvement in the unemployment rate and the slight improvement in wages.
The Nikkei index rose after publication of the gross domestic product (GDP) data, but as of the end of the morning, it was down by 0.74%.
The Japanese yen dropped after a short appreciation, and the transaction price hovered at about 118.15 yuan to about one US dollar.

Following the decision of the International Atomic Energy Agency to refer the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, Iran reiterated that the United States, one of the sponsors, has no room for negotiations.
Er, a spokesman for the Iranian government said on Monday: to date, it has been consistent with the US policy that it will not discuss and negotiate with the other party.
He said that it was a big mistake for the West to submit the nuclear issue to the Security Council, which shows that the West is blocking the development of Iran.
Iran said on Sunday that it would suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and resume uranium enrichment and prohibit surprise inspections of nuclear facilities.
Well, on this issue, Iran now has a relatively tough attitude, and the US stance is even stronger.
Er, US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld has reiterated on several occasions that it will not rule out the use of force on this issue.
Well, now there are rumors that the US military is really carrying out such a plan.
They are in the process of developing a super-large mother called bomb.
Er, as long as the Ministry of Defense makes an order, it will use this super-large bomb to bomb Iran.
So, how big is the mother of such a bomb?
It's said that it only weighs more than 30,000 pounds, which is equivalent to a second-tier bus, Er, and the size of it is also very large.
Well, the development of such a super bomb is mainly aimed at bombing some underground facilities in Iran.
This is because its penetrating power is very strong. It can pass through this mixed soil and steel plates. It will probably cause a large pit, Er, equivalent to 60 feet and a half miles, uh, it will damage many of the buildings and facilities underground.
Well, judging from the current situation, it seems that the United States has indeed started a temporary friction or a temporary bombing in this area.
Rumsfeld, that is to say, on this issue, the resolution of Iran's nuclear issue does not rule out any means. The means of force have been put on the table.
In addition, the issue of Iran's nuclear issue has been continuously escalating. Well, when interviewed by this station, the Iranian official said that Iran still insists on adopting a peaceful negotiation method to cooperate with the international community, Er, hoping to ease the crisis.
But he also said that Iran will adjust the content of Russian nuclear project cooperation.
Iran will hold a second round of talks with Russia on the uranium enrichment cooperation project on February 16. The Iranian side said that the negotiations will be carried out according to the original plan, but he stressed that the current events will make some adjustments to the content of the negotiations.
Russia had previously expressed support for Iran's peaceful use of nuclear energy and had indicated that it would insist not to refer the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council.
However, we now see that they have agreed to refer the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council.
Now that there is such a new situation, we may make some changes in our previous policies with the Russian side.
Before the UN Security Council finally decided whether to take economic and political sanctions in March, Iran advocated continuing negotiations with relevant international organizations, and was willing to cooperate with the international community in order to ease the current crisis.
We stress that in order to strive for its own economic development and national construction, Iran will not give up the power to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
Iran does not violate relevant international law. We hope the United States can also understand it.
The Iranian nuclear issue is completely different from the issues of Afghanistan and Iraq.
I think the United States itself is very clear about this point.
As for the so-called military strikes, we have not seen any clear statement from the US side.
We do not want to see a further escalation of the crisis.
We have also stressed the need to use the modalities of peaceful negotiations, but we will not give in to pressure.
In addition, ((agbi)) also expressed hope that China will continue to maintain cooperation with Iran on the basis of maintaining its original position.

Let's first take a look at today's headlines.
The State of the northeastern part of the United States and the Atlantic coast region have been hit by the first blizzard since winter started this morning.
The accumulated snow in some areas has exceeded 60 centimeters.
Several airports were forced to close.
More than 2,000 flights have been cancelled.
Well, New York City, Ah, has been in the first place, uh, with such huge snow.
Er, this is the second highest snowfall in history.
Let's take a look at the specific situation.
On Sunday morning, New York residents woke up and discovered that they were already in the white world.
Most of the buildings and streets in the outdoor area are covered with a thick layer of snow.
A total of 57.9 centimeters of snowfall was recorded in the New York Central Park.

Some of them will not be able to resume until Monday.
In the capital city of Washington, there is also a heavy snow, with snowfall exceeding 50 centimeters.
The grass and the skin are covered with white attire.
However, President Bush still went to worship in the church according to his habit.
Many people have come out of their homes to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the winter and have taken the opportunity to play with snow.
According to the radar of the Meteorological Department of the United States, there was widespread snowfall from the eastern part of Virginia to Burma.
In New Jersey, New York's Long Island, Connecticut and Maryland, residential and commercial electricity used to be disrupted after the blizzard.
It is estimated that more than 150,000 users have no electricity supply.
And in Europe, extensive areas are also affected by snowstorms.
Several thousand firemen and soldiers were deployed in the southern part of Germany to clean up the roof and the snow on the roads with police and volunteers.
It is still in a state of emergency after a few days of heavy snow after a few days of heavy snow.
Some small villages have lost contact with the outside world.
A total of 15 people died as a result of the accumulation of accumulated snow on the roof of batlahar, the state of Pakistan, last month.
This comprehensive report has been brought to you by Phoenix Satellite TV.
In the northeastern part of the United States, Um, it is hit by the big wind and snow, and New York, of course, is also one of the cities affected.
For the local situation, let's now connect with our correspondent Luo Xiaoying, who is stationed in New York.
Hello, Xiaoying.
Hello, Xiaonan.
Yeah.
Here we feel such a big snow, what kind of situation is it?
I hear that some places even have their electricity cancelled, aren't they?
What other areas are affected?
That's right.
Actually, this, this wind and snow area covers a wide range of areas.
I am very happy to tell you that now, we have finally seen that the blizzard has stopped.
Although this blizzard is very fierce, there have been no reports of major casualties.
Its coverage is affected in several states of the United States and the east. It has 21 inches of accumulated snow in the state of Maryland, 19 inches in Pennsylvania, and more than 24 inches in New York's jersey.
From Virginia to Burma, even the state of Tennessee, we can see some snow, Oh.
Well, Er, as you just said, Um, there is indeed a lot of local power outage in the Washington area and Baltimore.
The number of households with a total power outage is probably more than ten thousand.
Well, New York city is also good. The power outage in the city of Manhattan in New York City, Eh, the power supply situation is very normal. There is only some power outage in the Long Island area.
State of emergency has been declared in Lo de island state.
On the road, only emergency vehicles such as snow trucks and ambulances will be allowed to pass through.
In the area of transportation, Oh, earlier, the three major airports in New York, Eh, the three major airports in the region were closed.
But, Er, in the evening, we have found that some activities to resume the opening of the airport have begun to occur in New York's Newark Airport and the laaguia Airport in New York.
So it is estimated that some people may be able to open these airports for a few hours later.
Like the Delta airline, damus Air announced that all flights in places such as Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, and kangnadi state were grounded in all these places until Monday.
At present, this Reagan Airport in the capital of Washington is already open.
The bus in Jersey, New York, is now closed.
The frequency of trains will also be reduced.
Well, we are now, Er, now it is Sunday in New York, or Lantern Festival.
As far as Chinese people are concerned, for the Lantern Festival, some local Chinese communities have some lantern festival activities, but they have also been forced to cancel the Lantern Festival.
Well, generally, most of the New Yorkers' activities on Sunday are also cancelled. Oh, no one will leave the house, that is, they all stay at home.
Uh.
What do you do now? What are you going to do when you go to work on Monday?
The snow and the snow may cause some flooding.
As a result, the governments of the United States, Er, the affected areas are studying how to deal with the crowds of people who are going to work on Monday.
Xiaonan.
All right.
Thanks, Xiaoying, for sending us the latest report from the US.
Since there is no other way, I can only feel at ease about this, the beautiful scenery.
Let's look at some news about Japan.
Er, Koizumi has always wanted to upgrade the Japanese Defense Agency to a province so as to increase Japan's military strength.
But it has also caused a lot of controversy during this process, and it was also full of twists and turns.
Recently, the Defense Facilities Department of the Japanese Defense Agency had some scandals at the time of the tender invitation, which resulted in the arrest of current and former officials.
Therefore, many people suggested that Koizumi should be careful during the process of transferring the office to the province.
Well, recently, Koizumi has said that it will temporarily put aside such a plan and will not submit it to the parliament for consideration.
Well, he also hopes that the two parties in power will be able to discuss this issue carefully, to continue consultations.
In addition, there is another piece of news. If you go to Japan, there is a new rule.
That is, the Japanese plan is to stipulate that most of the tourists arriving in Japan will take fingerprints and photographs.
This is to prevent some unsafe elements from entering into Japan, and to prevent this illegal immigrant.
Er, so now, uh, it should be more troublesome to go to Japan.
Well, of course, recently there has been a happy event in Japan.
That is, the second son of Japan was very happy.
This matter has caused many Japanese, of course, to expect her to have a boy to inherit the throne.
However, she has also caused another stir in the royal family, which has been relatively calm.
Er, actually, this son is, of course, now a pregnant woman. Moreover, people have always thought that she was satisfied with the family of four.
At such a young age, many people could not help wondering that, Er, it might be a case of the royal family fighting the throne between brothers.
Of course, many people are talking about this conspiracy theory.
It may be necessary to talk about this matter several years ago.
Er, it was like this. At that time, in 2002, because it was Grand Prince Naruhito, his wife was suffering from depression. Well, at that time the royal family did not submit too much hope to them. In turn, they wanted to exert pressure on second Prince Edward.
At that time, Wen Ren did not have too many responses.
However, by the time of 2004, there were some intensification of the conflict, because Prince Naruhito, uh, was caring for his wife, and accused the royal family on this public occasion.
Well, it was said that the royal family was furious at that time, demanding that his older brother, the second prince of his generation, come out to refute his elder brother's disrespect for the royal family and spoil his own wife.
From then on, the brothers were unable to do so.
Well, now if a boy has given birth to a boy, then their main axis will become one of the pillars of the royal family.
And the East Palace, that is, the grand Prince, will certainly decline to such an extent.
Er, so many people think that if this is the case, it will have a great impact on the royal family and the Japanese society.
UN Secretary General Annan went to the White House on Monday to meet with US President Bush.
Regarding Iran's announcement of a postponement of nuclear talks with Russia, Annan called on Iran to halt nuclear activities as soon as possible and resolve the issue through negotiation instead of confrontation.
Also, it was said that the US Department of Defense has actually begun to closely bomb Iran's plan, which will be the final record after the failure of diplomatic efforts.
Originally, outsiders believed that Bush and Annan would discuss the possibility of joint security council sanctions against Iran, but they did not make public the discussions after the meeting.
Both Bush and Annan reiterated their hope for a negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear issue.
Annan expressed concern over Iran's beginning of uranium enrichment and the decision to postpone nuclear talks with Russia.
On the same day, US media reported that military strategy experts from the Pentagon have begun to strictly take military action against Iran, in order to prevent diplomatic efforts from failing, and that the United States will use military means to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
According to reports, the US Central Theater Commander is in the process of setting targets for attacks.
The attack could be carried out in the form of ballistic missiles launched by submarines, as well as air strikes by B2 bombers.
On Monday, Annan called on all parties not to take actions that would raise the crisis.
Analysis by military experts: Iran may have the ability to create nuclear weapons within two years.
In the second term, Bush will have more than two years.
He will strive to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue during his term of office, whether by peaceful or military means.
Mo Naiqian reporting from Washington for Phoenix Satellite TV.
Iranian President Ahmadinejad said on the 13th that the superpower that uses its own weapons to threaten other countries will soon disappear.
Ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys of various countries in Tehran on the occasion of the 27th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic revolution.
He said that there will be no results in the arms race and competition for hegemony in various countries of the world.
The appetite of the super-powers will never be satisfied, and they even use weapons to threaten other countries.
However, he said that these super powers, which rely on weapons to threaten other countries, will soon disappear.
The day of permanent peace and stability for mankind is about to come.
Therefore, we can see that now it is not only an oral battle, but actually it has become more and more intense between Iran and the western world and the United States.
Well, since the attitude between Iran and the United States is not mutually beneficial, recently, some changes have occurred in the form, that is, Iran officially announced the day before yesterday that they will resume uranium enrichment program.
In fact, some western diplomats speculated that they might have actually resumed some of the procedures for uranium enrichment prior to this.
In addition, Iran also announced that it would be an indefinite postponement and negotiations with the Russian side, that is, negotiations will be conducted by Russia instead of Iran to refine enriched uranium.
Well, of course, the indefinite postponement of this negotiation plan is also determined by the current new situation.
Well, recently, because the United States continues to threaten Iran, the British think tank is the Oxford Research Institute, which has issued such a report.
If the United States really uses force, then half of the people will die because of this. In addition, it will certainly trigger the wave of violence in the Middle East this year.
In addition, some, Um, terrorist attacks will intensify.
Of course, oil prices will also rise sharply. This is also within the effect of this series of dominoes.
Moreover, the report also says that if the United States does not yield to Iran, then it will definitely accelerate Iran's determination to make nuclear weapons.
Well, we just talked about the issue of negotiations between Russia and Iran.
The Iranian government spokesman indeed said on Monday that due to the new situation, it will pressure the Russian officials, who were originally scheduled to carry out uranium enrichment in Russia, on the 16th.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that they have not received any official notification from the Iranian side.
It is still too early to say whether the meeting will continue.
In addition, Russia's Federal International Atomic Energy and Energy director Gu Qi said on Monday that Russia is ready to negotiate with Iran to negotiate conditions and principles on the nuclear issue.
Also, recently, the New York Times of the United States published an editorial.
The topic of this editorial is also very conspicuous, it's called Japan's offensive foreign minister.
Well, this editorial specially mentioned that recently Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso made a series of very shocking remarks.
These remarks are very dishonest and very unwise. Moreover, these remarks have aroused widespread indignation among Asian countries.
Well, this editorial especially mentioned that the Japanese side should acknowledge its mistakes and learn the lessons, and not like what they have done during World War II in order to avoid mentioning some of the things they did during the war.
At the same time, the editorial also said that Taro Aso, many of his current remarks, for example, requested the prime minister to visit the Yasukuni Shrine, for instance, that the colonial rule of Japan had enhanced the standard of education in Taiwan. Moreover, it was very obvious that he did not have any historical knowledge or diplomatic art.
Well, the New York Times was the third largest in the United States last year, so it should have been very influential in the US society.
Therefore, this editorial should also be very influential.
At the same time, some former senior officials of the US government, as well as some US experts specializing in Asian issues, they held a special seminar, that is, a seminar on Sino-Japanese relations.
Well, at this seminar, some experts proposed such a viewpoint.
(He) said that the current Sino-Japanese relations are in a very tense period, and there is a danger of potential military conflict.
In addition, even the possibility of an outbreak of military conflict between China and Japan is even higher than the possibility of an outbreak of military conflict between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
Er, once a military conflict breaks out, the United States will definitely be dragged into the water because the US will surely become involved.
Also, a spokesman for Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who also participated in this seminar, said that indeed the current Sino-Japanese relations are at a very tense stage.
And any error can lead to serious consequences.
In addition, the Defense and Security Committee of the Georgian parliament held an expanded meeting and decided to expel the Russian peacekeeping force in the South Ossetia region.
The Russian parliament will hold a meeting today to consider this proposal.
Er, experts believe that if parliament approves the expulsion of Russian peacekeeping troops, it may lead to a complete break in the relations between Georgia and Russia.
A Russian peacekeeping force spokesperson said on the 14th that two military vehicles belonging to the Russian military peacekeeping force were intercepted by Georgian police and the drivers were expelled.
Er, the spokesman called on the Georgian side to immediately stop provocative activities like this, or else the Russian side would not be responsible for the consequences of the incident.
Two military vehicles belonging to the Russian peacekeeping force logistics system were inspected by Georgian police on Monday evening in South Ossetia, Georgia.
Police officers on duty in Georgia expelled Russian drivers and escort personnel and forced the two military vehicles away.
The incident has aroused the indignation of the Russian peacekeeping forces.
A spokesman for the Russian peacekeeping force said that on February 1st, Georgian police detained a Russian military vehicle in the area because of a traffic accident.
On February 8, another Russian military officer was detained for two days and nights on the pretext of a visa.
The arbitrary acts of provocation in Georgia were intended to bring bloodshed in the area and to force the Russian troops to open fire in order to achieve the goal of withdrawal of the peacekeeping forces from South Ossetia.
On the same day, the Russian embassy in Georgia made solemn representations to the government of Georgia, demanding that Georgia immediately stop its crazy provocations, otherwise the Russian side would not bear the consequences of the conflict.
The media pointed out that on February 13, Georgian Defense Minister Omar ashvili announced that the leader of the Russian military base in Karachi had sold a number of "Arrow" missiles to South Ossetia for the use of a number of "Arrow" missile systems.
On the same day, the National Defense and Security Committee of the Georgian parliament held an expanded meeting, listened to reports from the law enforcement departments, and decided to expel the Russian peacekeeping forces in Georgia and asked that the issue be considered at the Parliamentary Assembly on the 14th.
Experts believe that once the final decision is adopted, it may lead to a complete breakdown in the relationship between Georgia and Russia.
Prior to this, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Georgia, Zhu ashvili, strongly criticized Russia's position and refuted Russian President Putin's statement that if the West recognizes Kosovo, Russia may acknowledge the speeches of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, believing that the Russian authorities are sending signals of encouragement to all areas of separation.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also announced that it will protect Russian citizens in South Ossetia, which means a direct threat to Georgia.
Lu Yuguang reporting from Moscow for Phoenix Satellite TV.
Musharraf, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, announced on Tuesday that the United States will dispatch four aircraft carriers this summer to carry out the largest military exercise of the past 10 years in the Asia Pacific region.
Musharraf also said that the United States will not consider this China, Ah, as a threat.
The US military is hoping to have another joint exercise with the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy.
This statement immediately drew the attention of US defense experts.
The Heritage Foundation of the US think tank held a seminar on Wednesday on the defense assessment report of the Pentagon.
The delicate relationship between defence reports and military exercises has become one of the points of discussion.
Some are of the view that the public invitation to China to participate in the military exercise is a sign shown by the United States to China.
Since the US military invited China to participate in the military exercise, it also expressed the hope that the operation of the Chinese People's Liberation Army would be more transparent. Therefore, some defense experts believe that this shows that the Pentagon does not have the intention to expand its military strength and hopes to find out and test each other through the joint military exercise.
In addition, as the defense assessment report released by the Pentagon earlier this month has regarded China as the biggest potential threat in the future, the two defense experts also pointed out that the Asia-Pacific military exercise is the first step in the US Defense Department's adjustment strategy on this basis.
Xie Xiaoshuang reporting from Washington for Phoenix Satellite TV.
In addition, the military exercise in the United States during the summer is very concerned because it is also the first time in the United States that four aircraft carriers have participated in a military exercise, and for the first time since the Vietnam War, the United States has transferred the aircraft carrier on the east coast to the Western Pacific Region for the first time.
Well, the role of the army is actually very frequent. There will be four times in a few months.
Er, among them, there is also a multinational military exercise.
Well, this multinational military exercise includes Japan, South Korea, and Australia.

Studio.
Ok, OK.
Er, in addition, it was not the first time that Chinese engineers died in an attack in Pakistan.

Two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by armed groups in Yugoslavia.
In the end, one person died tragically in the rescue operation.
In addition, in May of the same year, three engineers also died in a bomb attack in guindel.
Let's review.
On May 3, 2004, in the port of melon port in the south of Pakistan's Balochistan province, a car carrying 12 Chinese vehicles was attacked by a car bomb on his way to the port construction site.
As a result, three Chinese engineers were killed and nine were wounded.
The attack was believed to have been launched by local separatist and tribal militias.
On October 9 of the same year, two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by armed elements in the South Waziristan area on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
At a later stage, when Pakistani troops rescued the hostages, an engineer unfortunately died in a gun.
However, this hostage incident is believed to be the work of an armed organization associated with al Qaeda, and not a division of arms.
Due to the close economic contacts between China and Pakistan and their participation in infrastructural projects in Pakistan, many Chinese engineers work there.
On the other hand, Pakistani armed groups have accused the government of robbing their natural resources.
As a result, the Chinese have repeatedly been the victims of attacks and kidnappings.

Let's look at some news from Japan.
Recently, there has been such a relatively sensational news in the Japanese political arena.
That is the elder Yomiuri Shimbun, the president of the Japanese media, who ordered the Yomiuri Shimbun to make some articles against Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine. Moreover, the Yomiuri Shimbun expressed opposition to Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine.
Er, well, this crossing across the border, during his speech a few days ago, he severely criticized Koizumi, saying he was very ignorant, and did not have any knowledge of history and culture.
At the same time, he also said that visiting Yasukuni Shrine is just like celebrating Hitler. In addition, he said that Koizumi's doing this also enabled China and South Korea to consider Japan as a very dangerous country. This will lead to endless troubles.
Well, why did it lead to a great shock when crossing the border?
In fact, he has been very influential in political circles and has always been the mastermind behind the scenes.
However, he was a very rightist figure in the past.
He should say he has always supported the Hawks, and he has also vigorously promoted the revision of the constitution.
But, uh, now they have really made a big turn.
He started to attack Koizumi at the beginning of the artillery bombardment, and began to oppose such an attitude.
In fact in 2004 when someone attacked Koizumi's Yasukuni Shrine, he also said, he said, Er, he supports and Wants Koizumi to withstand the pressure.
But recently he made a speech. He said that I am over 80 years old and there are not many days left.
Well, now he ((PW)) comes out in a high profile to speak with a kind of anti-war attitude.
It certainly has a very large impact on the entire social society of Japan.
For example, he said, "I am sure I have the strength to grasp and change the political wind."
And he also said that if the Yomiuri Shimbun was under pressure from the government in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of collection, he would die in resistance.
Well, now what kind of position has been formed?
That is, the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper, and Japan's second largest newspaper, that is, the Asahi Shimbun, Ah, now the two major newspapers have started to join hands in opposing Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine.
The two major newspapers turned out to be a challenge, but after that, the two chairmen met, and at least reached a consensus on this issue.
Therefore, now they have used a very large offensive to criticize Koizumi. It can be said that this has formed a dream group.
In fact, their two major newspapers should have a very large influence on the mainstream public opinion in Japan.
Also, let's take a look at the meeting of the House of Representatives in Japan. At a recent meeting, they said the same thing as the two most popular candidates for Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
Who are these two people?
One is Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe, and another is Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso, who has recently been repeatedly speaking.
What do both of them say?
That is to say, Japan's war criminals of World War II are not criminals.
What they mean is, Er, to describe them as crimes committed by criminals. This is the intention of the International Court of Justice.
While in Japan, according to international law, they have not committed Japan's domestic law according to the domestic laws of Japan.
Therefore, they believed that war criminals of World War II should not be regarded as criminals in Japan.
At the same time, Shinzo Abe also mentioned that Japan should now look around the world, develop relations with the United States, develop trade relations with some East Asian countries, and develop close ties with India as much as possible, and should not always focus on China.
New regulations on business management of China's electronic banking system to be effective on March 1
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) will take effect from March 1, 2006, according to the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC).
A spokesman for the CBRC said that according to the rules of management, the relevant examination and approval method of foreign financial institutions has basically remained unchanged, that is, if a foreign bank branch is allowed to operate online banking business, it should be reviewed and reviewed by the branch's main report in China.
In June 2001, the People's Bank of China enacted the "Interim Measures on Internet banking management" to regulate the use of the Internet by commercial banks.
A spokesman for the CBRC said that with the continuous development of commercial bank electronic banking business, the interim measures cannot meet the requirements of electronic bank risk supervision, and the CBRC has formulated two new rules.
According to the spokesman of the CBRC, the CBRC's determination of a safety assessment agency qualification is different from an administrative permit based on the nature of industry access or business entry qualification. It is not a necessary condition for an evaluation agency to conduct an electronic banking safety assessment, but only as a reference for financial institutions in selecting and evaluating institutions.
As long as the safety assessment agencies comply with the relevant conditions and requirements, financial institutions may also employ them to carry out an electronic banking safety assessment, but they should be managed in accordance with the relevant regulations.
The electronic banking business management scheme consists of nine chapters and 99 articles, which are divided into nine parts, namely general principles, application and change, risk management, data exchange and transfer management, management of operations, management of cross-border operations, supervision, management, legal responsibilities and by-laws.
The "Guidelines on electronic banking safety assessment" consists of five chapters and 57 articles, which are divided into five parts, namely general principles, safety assessment bodies, implementation of safety assessment, management of safety assessment activities, and by-laws.
"The investigation and study of Mao Zedong's Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping Theory" was published and published.
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) A book published by the Central Literature Publishing House has recently been published by the Central Literature Publishing House.
It is the basic experience and basic working method for the CPC to lead the revolution, construction, and reform.
The older generation of revolutionaries, such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, and Chen Yun, have made many important and brilliant expositions on research and research. They often go to the grassroots to conduct social surveys and write a lot of investigation reports.
Their study of the practice and results of the study has played an important role in guiding the cause of the Party and the people along the right path.
The book was divided into three parts: the first part was written by Mao Zedong and other revolutionaries of the older generation on research and research. The third part was the investigation report of the three investigation teams appointed by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, and Deng Xiaoping.
Most of these reports were published for the first time.
In addition, there are two summaries of the investigations carried out by the central leadership in the 1950s and 1960s.

(Overseas Chinese) third Chinese compatriots killed in South Africa in two days
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) The people of Fuqing, China's Fujian Province, were injured after being robbed by local armed elements on the early morning of the 5th, after being robbed by local armed elements.
According to Feng Yang, president of the provincial Chinese Federation of Free State, the incident took place in a bar in the city of welko, more than 130 kilometers northwest of Burundi.
At that time, the owner, Lin yi-hing, was packing up the articles in the bar and was preparing to close his business for one day.
At this time, there were three customers in the store. One of the customers pulled out a pistol into the bar and carried out the robbery.
Lin yi-xing, who was more than 40 years old, struggled with the burglar. The burglar fired a shot at Lin Yixing, and then fled.
Upon hearing the news, the local people rushed to the hospital for treatment.
On February 6, the Consulate General of the Chinese People's Republic of China and the vice president of the Chinese People's Republic of China, Lin Changming, and the vice president of the South African Association of Fujian, Lin Changming, drove to Bloemfontein to assist the family members of the deceased in dealing with the aftermath of the accident.
Lin yi-hsing became the third Chinese who was shot dead in 36 hours. He was also the fourth Chinese to be killed in South Africa since the beginning of this year.
(newspaper selection) Shanghai: part-time workers and university graduates become the main force for hours of work
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) The Shanghai Municipal Labor and Social Security Bureau (labor and social security bureau) announced here today that the number of posts has reached 120, which is 11 more than the previous one.
According to estimates by experts of the Shanghai Municipal Labor and Social Security Bureau, currently more than one million workers are working in Shanghai.
According to a report by the China Youth Daily, university graduates and part-time workers are the main components of the hourly workforce.
Through a direct survey of nearly 8,000 hours of work, more than half of the staff were part-time, with a proportion of 51.1 per cent.
The cultural level of part-time workers is generally higher. They are mainly engaged in more technical work, such as translation posts. The proportion of part-time workers is as high as 81.7%.
High income is one of the major reasons why many people take up part-time jobs.
It is understood that the monthly income of individual posts can reach tens of thousands of yuan, and it will be hard to seek, like sound interpretation. Most of the monthly income for an hourly job can reach more than $2,000, such as part-time finance, wedding ceremonies, and so on.
Meeting the interests of individuals and expanding their knowledge is also an important reason for the favor of part-time workers.
In the case of an enterprise as the manager of the human resources department, a few hours a week will be used to deal with the financial accounts of a foreign representative office.
In his view, the biggest gain of part-time work is to keep his knowledge continuously updated and to have an opportunity to deal with another area. Of course, the monthly income of $2,000 will also be attractive.
Due to the low employment threshold for some hours of work and the flexible freedom of work, it is gradually being favored by many of the graduates who are seeking employment. 14% of the hours of work are for nearly three years.
"I didn't want to work for an hour at the beginning, but after a few months, I felt it was better to go to work at 9: 00."
After junior college students graduated, the job they found was unsatisfactory. In the end, they hung up a name in a hotel and used piano to play the background music.
"I am quite satisfied with the work now. The hour is 100 yuan and the environment is good. What I want to do now is to find a few more hours of work."
It has been learned that working hours have become an important way for some of the graduates who are seeking employment to accumulate work experience, exercise skills, improve communication skills, and increase social experience.
Graduates work on an hourly basis, focusing mainly on more intellectual and technical skills, such as more professional translators, with a share of 22.1 per cent and 26.8 per cent, respectively.
The skills required for part-time jobs are not high, such as food promotion workers and freight forwarders, and those who are unemployed will be able to do so through simple training.
The data show that the proportion of unemployed workers is as high as 39 percent of the unemployed. Among these, the proportion of unemployed people in the retail sector is 68.4%, while the proportion of restaurants is 58.7%, and hours have become an important channel for the employment of the unemployed.

China should focus on carrying out research on the carrier and regulation principles and methods of mass communication and the new quantitative effects of the small quantum system, and the new principles and the new technology base for measurement and measurement.
In addition, the outline pointed out that nanotechnology has become a strategic choice for many countries to raise their core competitiveness. It is also one of the areas in which China is expected to develop by leaps and bounds.
In the next 15 years, the focus of China's research in this area will include the control and control of nanotechnology, electronics, nanotechnology and nanotechnology, and the application of nanotechnology and nanotechnology in the fields of energy, environment, information, medicine, and so on.
With a large population growth, a large number of birth defects, a serious shortage of organ transplants, and the imminent arrival of an ageing population, there is an urgent need for breakthroughs and technological innovations in reproductive and developmental science theories.
According to the outline, from 2006 to 2020, China will focus on research on stem cell multiplication, division, and control, the occurrence of reproductive cells, maturity and fertilization, the recession of the human reproductive function, and the mechanism for withdrawal of sexual diseases, as well as the safety and ethics of reproductive and stem cell technology.

Chinese expert: US advocacy of "Chinese military threat" groundless accusations
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) The "four year defense assessment report," which was officially submitted to the National Assembly recently by the Pentagon, said that China is "the most likely new power to pose a military challenge to the United States."
Experts believe that this is unreasonable criticism of China's normal national defense construction, and the "China military threat theory" is an interference in China's internal affairs.
The "four-year defense assessment report" is the new defense guidance document of the Pentagon.
The report contains three paragraphs on China's military strength and the response that the United States should take. The report says, "as a major and emerging power, China has the greatest potential for military competition with the United States. If the United States does not take countermeasures, China is likely to develop destructive military technology, thus breaking the United States' advantage in conventional weapons."
Yao Yunzhu, a researcher at the World Military Research Department of the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, said that although senior US officials have repeatedly expressed similar views in the past, this is the first time that the United States has proposed in the "national defense strategy report" that "China is the most likely new nation to pose a military challenge to the United States."
"This report made it clear for the first time that Russia, India, and China as an emerging strategic opponent have given more attention to the so-called 'China military threat theory'."
Major General Peng Guangqian, researcher at the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, said.
It is worth noting that on the same day that the "four-year defense assessment report" was officially submitted, US President Bush also submitted to Congress the government's budget for the 2007 financial year, which included a defense budget of US $43.3 billion.
"If this is added to the additional budget for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US defense budget for fiscal year 2007 will break through the US $500 billion mark, creating a new historical high," says Peng Guangqian. "This is almost the sum of military spending in all other countries of the world."
Peng Guangqian said: The method used by the United States to establish the "threat theory of other countries" reflects the consistent style of the Pentagon "creating the enemy." its true purpose is to secure more national defense funds and obtain more profits from the huge US arms industry.
Experts say that compared with the huge military spending in the United States, China's defense spending is rather limited.
Deng Hongzhou, a military expert who has repeatedly participated in China's national defense white paper, said that since the beginning of the 1990s, China's national defense costs have increased as a result of economic development. However, the proportion of national financial expenditures in the same period has been on a downward trend.
Official data show that, compared with 1979, China's national defense expenses accounted for nearly 10 percentage points of national fiscal expenditure in the same period.
In 2005, China's national defense funds amounted to 246.46 billion yuan, only about 1 / 14 percent of the United States. Its per capita military spending is only about 1 / 60 in the United States, and the military's per capita military spending is about 1 / 30 of the US military.
"The land area of the United States is roughly the same as China's land area, but the difference in military spending is so great that its military strength goes beyond the legitimate defense needs. This is self-evident."
Mr Pang said.
Teng chien-chun, director of the Research Department of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, said that the US side should objectively evaluate the state of China's military construction. China's peaceful development does not mean that China and the United States will become military opponents in the future.
The white paper "China's National Defense in 2004" says that China firmly follows the path of peaceful development and implements defensive national defense policy.
China has not and will not pose any threat to any country.
To date, China has not established military bases in any other country and has not sent a single soldier to other countries, while the United States has more than 100 military bases overseas and has deployed more than 100,000 troops in the Asian region alone.
Zhu Feng, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at Beijing University, said that China and the United States should increase communication and exchanges through established channels, increase mutual understanding and mutual trust, promote the constructive and cooperative relations between China and the United States in the new century, and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development.
(Winter Games) the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games will be staged at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games.
Turin, February 9 (Xinhua) The opening ceremony of the 20th Winter Olympic Games will open today at 8: 00 p.m. local time.
On the 9th, the organizing committee of the Winter Olympic Games in Turin revealed to reporters the excellent arrangements for the opening ceremony.
As for the opening ceremony, the chairman of the organizing committee of the organizing committee, castles, was full of confidence. He said at a press conference that the opening ceremony would cost tens of millions of euros and brought together top officials from all walks of life in Italy.
He said that the night of 10 May would be an unforgettable night when the 35,000 viewers and about 2 billion television viewers around the world would see the opening ceremony, which was full of passion and success, "he said.
At the opening ceremony, the director said, "passion, vitality and Italian talent will be the theme of the opening ceremony." As the largest Winter Olympic Games in history, he will show people the spirit of Italy's long history and culture as well as the spirit of peace advocated by the Olympic Games.
The famous Italian design master Arima specially designed clothes for the opening ceremony. The famous Italian fashion brand mosquo will provide formal dress for the participants in the entry ceremony for the athletes.
However, whether there will be a song on the opening ceremony at the opening ceremony, the organizing committee will keep this suspense at the end of the ceremony.
The eight "Ice hockey athletes" who are able to fire the flame will use a three-meter long flame to show the passion of combustion, and they will shuttle several times at a speed of 70 km.
The organizing committee officials believed that this was the most satisfactory creation in their performance at the opening ceremony.
As for how to light the main torch, the organizing committee did not reveal it in advance, but the main torch relay, as high as 57 meters, will illuminate the residents in Turin and the vicinity.
(international) White House announces Bush's plan to visit Pakistan and India in March
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) President Bush will visit Pakistan and India in March.
McClellan said that Bush is looking forward to visiting Pakistan and India.
He also said that arrangements were being made for such a visit.
McClellan made the above remarks while holding various demonstrations in some parts of Pakistan in protest against the desecration of the Islamic Prophet Mohammed.
During his meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Aziz at the White House in January this year, the two sides expressed the need to strengthen friendly cooperation and jointly combat terrorism that would endanger the security of the two countries.
Bush also said that he would visit Pakistan and India in March at the invitation of the Pakistani and Indian governments.
(international observation) Hamas cabinet seeks breakthrough
Xinhua News Agency, Ramallah, February 9 (Xinhua) The Hamas cabinet is seeking a breakthrough in its cabinet.
The following is a list of major world events scheduled for October 1 to 6:.
Following the victory of the Legislative Council election of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance (Hamas), how to outline a new government blueprint has become the focus of current international attention.
What new policies the Hamas will pursue will have a direct impact on the corresponding policy orientation of the parties involved in the peace process.
At the same time, the resistance of the United States and Israel has added variables to the prospects of the Hamas government.
At present, the Palestinian parties are stepping up consultations to actively seek a breakthrough on the difficulties and sensitivities involved in the future development of the cabinet.
In the office of the prime minister, who is the winner?
After Hamas got the cabinet, some outsiders were worried that the "Hamas prime minister" might have differences with the current top leader Abbas.
Moreover, Hamas leader Meshaal, who is visiting Egypt, stressed that the new Palestinian government formed by the Hamas will not recognize Israel, and this strong signal has also aggravated international concern.
The United States and Israel clearly indicated that they would not accept a Hamas government with real power, and in this way threatened to cut off economic aid to Palestine and transfer taxes to the Palestinians.
However, this does not prevent Hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments, and the selection of an independent person is a compromise.
It has been reported that in order to obtain international recognition to the fullest extent, the Hamas leaders at home and abroad who gathered in Egypt recently decided to elect an independent person and the chairman of the board of directors of the University of the Islamic University of Gaza, Jia Meren, to be the new prime minister.
This initiative has not yet received a response from the parties concerned.
Palestinian analyst Hussain said that no matter who will win the post of prime minister, the most important thing is that the candidate for the prime minister should play down the "tough" characteristics of Hamas as far as possible. Only in this way can the success of the cabinet be ensured.
How will the power be distributed?
From an internal point of view, the biggest challenge faced by the Hamas cabinet is the lack of sufficient experience in administration.
According to an analysis in the Palestinian daily newspaper, Hamas has gained popularity through social welfare projects, but it lacks experience in administration. Cooperation with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), which has experience in administration, is the best course of action.
After the election, Hamas proposed to establish a "political partnership" with Fatah and jointly set up a national coalition government. However, Fatah has so far not given any positive response.
At present, there are different opinions within Fatah on whether or not to enter the cabinet. One faction proposes to participate in the new government, thus doing something; the other rejects Hamas's invitation and is willing to be a "active opposition party" in the legislature.
Sources said that under Abbas' persuasion, Fatah gradually tended to join the new government.
Even so, Hamas and Fatah will also bargain over the distribution of cabinet positions.
In addition, the other way is to set up a cabinet that is outside the framework of the Legislative Council.
It is reported that Hamas has also designed a single expert government, but the specific list is not known.
In view of the attitude of the United States and Israel, the technical expert government is also a form of cabinet that reduces external pressure.
According to the Palestinian basic law, following the inauguration of the new legislature on the 16th of this month, the nomination of the prime minister and the formation of a cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks.
Where will the armed forces go?
Weapons in the hands of Hamas are another difficult problem facing the formation of a new government.
The attitude of the United States and Israel is very tough. They resolutely demand that Hamas renounce violence and refuse to take part in politics.
Hamas leader Meshaal stressed on the 9th that armed resistance is a "strategic choice" of the organization.
The issue of armed forces is, in fact, a matter of both the legitimacy of arms and the management of the armed forces.
Through a democratic and liberal election, Hamas was elected as the first largest party to the legislature, and the way in which the "Al Qassam Brigade" of its subordinate armed factions was also legalized was to unify it into the government's security organs.
Hamas once proposed the unification of the various factions into the "People's Army" of the Palestinian National Authority, but it did not receive a wide response. It was also criticized by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad organization (Jihad).
Palestine currently has more than 60,000 security personnel, most of them from the Fatah camp.
In addition, Fatah also has some loosely organized armed factions such as the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and the "Fatah Eagle".
Hamas, which is in charge of forming a cabinet, must agree with Abbas on how to manage these separate armed forces and rationally distribute security power.
According to local media reports, Abbas intends to charge security and intelligence units while police and civil defence institutions are managed by the Ministry of the interior of the new government.
However, consultations are still under way on this sensitive issue, which has not yet been followed up.
China's first polar expedition report released
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) China's State Oceanic Administration (SOA) has issued the "2005 China polar study report" recently. This is the first time that China has issued such a report over the past 20 years.
The "report" fully reflects the situation of China's polar scientific research activities in 2005, the logistic support for polar expeditions, and the major progress and achievements of polar scientific research.
According to the report, on 9 January 2005, at 22: 15 (Beijing time), the Chinese Antarctic expedition to the inland icecap was successful in reaching the highest elevation of the Antarctic inland icecap. At 3: 15 on January 18 (Beijing time), the height of Dome-A was 4,093 meters high.
"on the stage of an increasingly competitive international polar expedition, the Chinese people, relying on their strong will and courageous spirit, have the courage to explore new areas, first carrying out the impact on the highest point of the Antarctic ice cap, and successfully realizing another dream for mankind in the Antarctic."
Sun Chih-hui, director of the State Oceanic Administration, said.
The report shows that on March 24, 2005, China's 21st Antarctic expedition team returned to Shanghai after successfully completing its mission. The expedition lasted 151 days and lasted 26500 nautical miles.
On November 18 of the same year, China's 22nd Antarctic expedition team left Shanghai for a scientific expedition to the Antarctic Zhongshan Station, and will leave Zhongshan station before the end of February 2006 to return to Shanghai via Australia.
Because it was China's first polar expedition report, the 2005 China polar expedition report also reviewed and summed up the Chinese polar expeditions that started in the early 80s of the 20th century.
According to the report, China formally acceded to the Antarctic Treaty in 1983 and became a member of the Antarctic Treaty Organization and has successively become a member of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative parties, the Antarctic Scientific Research Council, the Antarctic Bureau of directors, and so on.
In 1997, China became a member of the Arctic scientific committee and won the voice and decision-making power in international polar affairs.
The "report" points out that, for more than 20 years, China's polar expedition to the south and the Arctic, which was established in February 1989, was established in February 1989, the Antarctic Zhongshan Station, which was established in February 1989.
According to the report, as of the end of 2005, China has organized 22 Antarctic scientific expeditions and two research tours to the North Pole with the "snow dragon" as the carrying platform. To date, more than 3,000 inspection team members have visited the South and the North Pole.
"At present, we are doing a feasibility study on the establishment of the third Antarctic research station, which is also China's first Antarctic inland research station."
Sun Chih-hui says.
"After more than 20 years of hard work, China's polar expeditions have occupied a place in the world's polar expeditions. However, compared to other major polar expeditions, there is still a large gap. We must catch up."
He said.
Sun Chih-hui disclosed that China will publish a report on polar expeditions every year in the future.

(Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan) and Hutchison Whampoa announced the postponement of the listing of "three Italy"
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, February 11 - Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. announced on the 11th that it will postpone the implementation of the listing plan of the 3G telecommunications company '3 Italy'.
Fok chien-ning, general manager of the Yellow Group, said that although "3 Italy" has been approved by all relevant regulatory authorities, it will be too hasty for the process to be completed in the next few weeks.
At the same time, as the European telecommunications market is weak, the market may not be able to give "3 Italy" a suitable listing value at this moment.
In view of the maximum benefit for shareholders, it was decided to postpone the listing.
As for when they will continue to be listed on the market, Fok chien-ning said that it will depend on the situation of the European telecommunications market in the future.
In his view, the "3 Italy" need to launch a wide range of investor education activities between now and the other, so that the global telecommunications investment market will have a clearer understanding of the current strong performance and favorable prospects of the "three Italy".
In addition, according to media reports, the investment bank Goldman Sachs, one of the "three Italian" global coordinators, agreed to hold 10% of the "3 Italy" shares through private placement. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of March this year.
The development of economic and trade relations between China and Burma (overseas) has great potential for development.
YANGON, February 12 (Xinhua) The economic and trade relations between China and Myanmar are rich in content, diversity, mutual benefit, and common development.
He said that in recent years, the good-neighborly and friendly relations between China and Myanmar have been consolidated and developed on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. Exchanges and cooperation in various fields have expanded and deepened, and economic and trade relations between the two countries have been continuously expanded and strengthened.

He said that 2004 was US $11.4 billion; in 2005, it was US $12.09 billion, of which China's exports were US $950 million and imports 272 million US dollars.
In the bilateral trade last year, China's trade with Myanmar (including cross-border trade) amounted to 630 million US dollars, an increase of 14.6 percent over the previous year.
Tang Hai said that Myanmar has become one of the major markets for Chinese enterprises to carry out contract work. China's major projects in Myanmar include power stations, bridges, piers and factories (such as sugar factories, textile factories, cement factories, paper collection plants) and so on.
The construction of Chinese enterprises in Myanmar has led to the export of all kinds of electrical and mechanical products in China, and Myanmar has become one of the major markets for China's export of equipment and electrical and mechanical products.
According to statistics of the Chinese Customs, the export volume of electrical and mechanical products has accounted for about 45 percent of China's total exports to Myanmar in the past five to six years.
Mr Tang also said that Myanmar is rich in resources, and that Chinese companies have begun to invest in such resource development projects as Myanmar's oil, nickel and copper mines, and there is great potential for the development of economic and trade cooperation between China and Myanmar.
He hoped that Chinese enterprises would have a long-term vision; they should learn to avoid risks and be prudent in making decisions. They must establish a good corporate image.
He said that it is important to promote mutual political trust, promote bilateral cooperation, and promote the further development of the friendly relations between China and Myanmar.
The two sides are expected to sign several documents on economic and trade cooperation during the visit.
World Bank to grant debt relief to the poorest countries
MOSCOW, February 11 (Xinhua) World Bank President Wolfowitz said here today that the World Bank will completely cancel the debts of the poorest countries by the middle of this year.

HDTV digital television becomes mainstream in the United States
New York, February 12 (Xinhua) as the price of high resolution television (HDTV) continues to decline and the market continues to expand, US TV broadcasters have also stepped up the introduction of corresponding HDTV programs.
The "Super bowl" of the United States, which has just come to an end, has become a warm-up match for American broadcasters in greeting the HDTV era.
According to a recent report by the Financial Times, the US Congress recently passed a bill requiring US broadcasters to completely stop broadcasting the existing analog TV signals on February 17, 2009, and can only broadcast digital signals.
This means that there is a clear timetable for the comprehensive digital broadcasting of television programs in the United States.
On the one hand, high resolution digital television has to rely on consumers to buy television sets, while on the other hand, it has to rely on production agencies to provide HDTV programs.
Although digital television has been mentioned repeatedly in the past few years, it has not yet become a reality.
This issue has taken a turn for the better this year.
According to a forecast by the US Consumer Electronics Association, the number of digital television sets will exceed traditional television sets for the first time this year, while 85 percent of the digital television sets are high-resolution products.
Japanese researchers develop new types of highly efficient artificial kidneys
TOKYO, February 13 (Xinhua) researchers from the East China Sea University have developed a biological kidney that has the same functions as human kidneys.
According to a recent report by the Nikkei industry news, the newly developed bioman-made kidney is mainly composed of two parts. Part of it is a "man-made kidney" from the blood filtering of metabolic wastes and moisture.
The "artificial kidney" and "artificial urine tubes" are made from the bottom line, and the inner side of the "artificial urine tube" is filled with the urine of the urine, which has the function of splitting up metabolic wastes.
This kind of skin cells can result in diseases caused by multiple blood dialysis - the cause of the disease, which is the cause of the disease, has been broken down into ammonia and returned to blood. At the same time, it is able to return to the blood, such as the necessary glucose, vitamin and minerals, and so on.
In the past, the difference between a man-made kidney that relied on osmotic pressure to filter the metabolic waste could not be completely removed, and it did not have the function of returning the ingredients of ammonia to the blood.
The researchers made use of the goats to carry out a biological kidney transplant experiment, and the inner wall of the man-made kidney was used to use the skin of the pig's skin.
Two weeks later, researchers confirmed that the kidney had been able to function.
At present, they are developing bioman-made kidneys using human kidney cells and will proceed to clinical research after verification of their safety.
China's power safety production still faces tough challenges
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) electricity safety is still facing severe challenges, the head of the state power supervision committee said on Tuesday.
At the fifth (expanded) meeting of the national electricity safety commission held here today, the vice chairman of the national electricity safety commission said that China's electricity safety production was stable in 2005.
However, he pointed out that with the changes in the supply and demand situation and the large number of new generation units coming into operation, electricity safety production will face new challenges.
These challenges include the continued shortage of electricity supply in parts of the region as a result of the lack of effective control of electricity supply and the lack of effective control of electricity supply.
Shi Yubo said that with the deepening of the reform of the power system, many deep-seated contradictions will continue to be exposed, how to maintain the stability of the workforce and ensure that normal production order will become a new problem.
With regard to electricity safety production in 2006, Shi Yubo said that it is necessary to further establish and improve the safety management mechanism for electricity safety, increase the coordination and coordination of electrical power systems, and continue to improve the safety of power systems.
It is reported that in the light of the new situation of electricity safety management, the authority will revise and improve the "Provisional Regulations on the investigation of electricity production accidents" this year. At the same time, a complete set of supporting documents on the safety of the hydroelectric dam and the second system will be issued this year.
In 2005, the total electricity consumption in China was 2468.9 billion kwh, an increase of 13.45% compared to the same period last year.
In view of the fact that the situation of supply and demand for electricity is still tight, and there are other unfavorable factors such as the contradictions in the transportation of coal and electricity, various power companies have taken effective measures to strengthen the management of their equipment. In the whole of last year, there were no major equipment accidents in the whole country.
There were 74 cases of power grid accidents, 127 in the same period and 427 in equipment accidents, a decrease of 132 times over the same period last year.
South African envoy to China says South Africa does not have "organized" crimes against Chinese citizens
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) South Africa does not have an organized crime against Chinese citizens.
At the same time, he said, the South African government will do its utmost to "combat all forms of criminal activity."
He said the South African government hopes that the crime rate will be reduced to zero, and that the lives and property of all foreigners working in South Africa will be fully protected by local laws and citizens.
Since 2006, four Chinese citizens have been killed one after another in South Africa. The Chinese world has expressed widespread concern over this.
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made representations to the South African side on this issue and has reminded citizens of southern China to further enhance their awareness of security and to strengthen solidarity among overseas Chinese and to cooperate with the police in cracking down on crimes.
"We extend our most sincere sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims."
He said, "We apologize for this and ask the Chinese people to believe that the South African government is seriously investigating every case involving China."
According to a briefing given by the Chinese Embassy in South Africa, the South African police have successfully detected a case in which Chen chien-ching, a Chinese woman in Fujian, was killed in South Africa on February 5. A suspect has been arrested.
At present, the police are hunting for another suspect.
In addition, according to the South African embassy in China, the criminals suspected of killing Hong Kong businessmen in January this year have been arrested by the South African police and the victims' property has been recovered.
Commenting on the possible impact of the killing of Chinese citizens, he said that these incidents "indeed" would have some negative impact on trade, tourism, and other fields between the two countries. However, in the long run, the impact "should not be great."
During the first 15 days of this year, the embassy issued visas to more than 2,000 Chinese people to South Africa.
In addition, according to Chinese official statistics, South Africa will continue to maintain the status of China's largest trading partner in Africa in 2005.
The volume of bilateral trade reached $72.7 billion, an increase of 23 percent over the same period last year.
However, people in the tourism industry believe that the continued killing of Chinese citizens in 2004 has had a clear impact on China's travel to South Africa.
According to statistics of the South African Tourism Bureau, the number of Chinese tourists visiting South Africa in the first half of 2005 was 20,331, a decrease of 14.9% over the same period last year.
At present, there are about 200,000 Chinese living in South Africa, and they are located in towns and villages in South Africa.
Analysts here believe that there is a large gap between the rich and the poor in South Africa, the high unemployment rate, the proliferation of firearms, and the absence of the death penalty, so the crime rate remains high.
Since many Chinese do not understand English, there is cash in the body and at home, which is more likely to be the object of financial attacks by criminals.

Beijing University set up memorial hall to mourn Wang selection
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 15 (Reporter Li Jiangtao) after a few days of tense arrangements, the Memorial Hall of the Beijing University was officially opened at 9: 00 a.m. on the 15th. As of noon on that day, hundreds of people had come to pay their respects.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the opening hours of the mourning hall have not yet come to an end, and there are already dozens of people in front of the door.
In the Memorial Hall of the lecture hall for the Centenary of Peking University, this reporter saw a black banner hanging on the walls of the Hall: "deep mourning for the members of Wang's election."
Under the banner was a huge portrait of a dozen or so square meters of Wang's election. He was wearing glasses, with a smile on his face and his temperament.
The two sides, on both sides of the wall, were placed on both sides of the river, and dozens of wreath were placed on both sides.
One of them, a wreath, wrote, "it's from Qin Sheng to the glory of the Tang Dynasty, the foundation of the founding of the Chinese People's Republic of China.
The atmosphere in the mourning hall was low, and the atmosphere was solemn and heavy.
Among the people who paid their respects were Peking University leaders and teachers and students, as well as friends, colleagues, students, and neighbors. There were also many people who were not familiar with him.
Some of them were holding flowers in their hands, and some were carrying flower baskets. Each of them wore small white flowers in their chest, slowly walking to the left of Wang's selection of academicians.
Many people could not afford to shed tears.
Zhang Wenbin, former director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, was an old alumni of Peking University. He told reporters that more than 10 years ago he was still working in Henan Province. He once asked professor Wang to give a report on scientific and technological innovations to the provincial party committee cadres.
"The conduct and study of the fellows is a good example of our study. He has made a great contribution to the country and society, and the people will never forget him."
Professor Kim shui-lin of the Peking University School of Law is an old friend and an old neighbor for more than 40 years.
He had just been discharged from the hospital a few days ago. He persisted today to bid farewell to his old friend.
When Mr. Jin sent a message on the message book, he could not hold back his grief, and had to use paper to remove his tears from his eyes.
He told the reporter that the life of Professor Wang was very frugal. "When he was living in the garden, he was already a professor, and he already had a very high degree of success, but he still lived in a very small house for many years.
Later, he moved to chengze Garden, where he lived for more than ten years at an area of 70 square meters.
Beijing University gave him a large house of more than 140 square meters located at the blue flag camp. He didn't want it; he didn't want the top housing in the building. "
Mr. Jin recalled with deep feeling that during his visit abroad, Wang chose to leave him with a very high degree of treatment, but he refused to do so.
"At first, he insisted that he did not apply for the fellows, but after he had been mobilized several times, he went to fill in the form."
Mr. Jin was deeply impressed by Wang's attitude toward the development of young people. "He himself has stressed on many occasions that I still have something to do, not to look at myself, but rather to cultivate young people."
Mr. Jin said that when he was a few years old, he began to pay attention to the training of young people. He always stressed the need to pave the way for young people to make way for the young.
"This is not easy for a very successful scientist."
The reporter learned from the Beijing University news center that from 9: 00 a.m. to 12: 00 noon on the morning of February 15, from 9: 00 a.m. to 16: 00 a.m., members of the public are open to the public and are open to the public.

China to introduce information network dissemination rights protection bill
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) A large number of websites have not been authorized and no charges have been paid.
According to the law, according to the existing law, as long as the author does not make a statement that the author does not use it, the newspaper can use his work without the author's consent.
However, in accordance with the provisions of the existing law, the newspaper is entitled to such statutory permission, and the Internet does not enjoy the right to such a statutory authorization.
According to the relevant judicial interpretation given by the Supreme People's Court, such use of the statutory authorization may be applied to the Internet, that is, the newspaper and the short articles published on the Internet.
However, since the judicial interpretation does not provide for remuneration standards, the use of these works by the Internet has not been paid in practice.

"Whether or not to incorporate it into the scope of the law is yet to be confirmed by the information network protection ordinance, which is to be introduced this year."
(international) Russian military says Georgian parliament resolution will not affect Russian peacekeeping operation
MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) Russia will continue to carry out its peacekeeping mission in South Ossetia, the Russian Defense Ministry said today.
The Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament), the chairman of the Council of the Commonwealth of Independent States, said on the same day that this resolution will undermine the stability of the situation in the region and adversely affect the relations between Russia and Georgia.
He stressed that the parliamentary resolution has made the relationship between Russia and Georgia a step forward in the direction of worsening the relations between the two countries.
He believes that the accusations made by the Russian side against Russia are absurd.
The Georgian parliament passed a resolution on the same day demanding that Russian peacekeeping troops stop their peacekeeping operations in South Ossetia, but they did not establish a specific deadline for the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping troops.
The parliament accused Russian peacekeepers of failing to comply with their obligations and regarded Russian actions in areas of conflict as "an attempt to annex the territory of Georgia."
The parliament called on the government to take positive action to consider replacing the current Russian peacekeeping operation in the region of South Ossetia with international peacekeeping forces.
The parliament also instructed the government to revise the relevant agreements to determine the presence of Russian peacekeepers in areas of conflict.
South Ossetia is an autonomous region in Georgia and borders on the North Ossetia republic of Russia.
After the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, it declared itself independent and was in a state of confrontation with the central government for a long time.
At present, Russia is stationed in the region with a peacekeeping battalion of 500 people.
The force was established on the basis of an agreement signed in 1992 between Russia, Georgia, North Ossetia and South Ossetia.
Four persons responsible for major accident in Liaoning hospital charged
Changchun, February 16 (Xinhua) the accident investigation team has confirmed 11 people responsible for the accident.
On December 15, 2005, a fire broke out in the central hospital, the largest hospital in Liaoning Province, resulting in the death of 39 people.
In this fire, the burned area was over 5,000 square metres.
It is understood that this is the biggest fire accident in the national medical and health system since the founding of New China.
According to a survey, at around 1630 hours on the day of the incident, the hospital in the central hospital of Liaoning Province suddenly went out of power and, according to the design of the hospital's circuit, would automatically jump to the entrance gates to maintain the normal supply of electricity.
At that time, there were more than ten underground cables running together. The cables, like these, should be placed in a very neat and orderly manner, and a fire layer should be set up.
As a result, Zhao Yongchun, head of the electrical installation team of the Liaoning provincial textile company, and the retired worker (senior engineer) Sun Fenglin (senior engineer), and the retired staff of the Central Hospital of Liaoning Province, are also liable to prosecution for crimes of major responsibility.

(Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan) Taiwan authorities impose heavy penalties on high-tech leading enterprises based on illegal investment in mainland China
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) The Department of Economic Affairs of the Taiwan authorities today decided to punish the United Microelectronics Company Limited ("UMC").
Taiwan's "China Times" reported that this is the first example of Chen Shui-bian's proposal of "active management and effective opening" for cross-strait economic and trade policy, and the Taiwan authorities have imposed penalties on Taiwan businessmen investing in the mainland.
According to the report, a person from Taiwan's "Ministry of Economic Affairs" said that UMC was punished for violating the regulations of the People's Republic of China on the two sides of the strait and the regulations on investment or technical cooperation in the mainland.
In the future, the "investment commission" will also impose a fine on the former chairman of UMC, Robert Tsao, and others, as appropriate.
The "joint electricity case" began in February 2005. At that time, the Taiwan prosecution department carried out surprise inspections of the houses and offices of several high-ranking officials in UMC, claiming that UMC was suspected of "illegally providing funds, technology, and human resources" for the mainland investment.
Robert Tsao, who was then chairman of UMC, subsequently said publicly that UMC had not violated any regulations of the Taiwan authorities. UMC's assistance to He Jian Technology (Suzhou) Co., for the long-term benefit of UMC, would lose business opportunities if UMC did not enter the mainland market as soon as possible.
Subsequently, the "financial supervision and management committee" of the Taiwan authorities imposed a new NT $3 million fine for UMC on the ground that it violated the regulations on disclosure of commercial information.
On January 9, 2006, UMC's board of directors accepted Robert Tsao's resignation. Robert Tsao was formally charged a few hours later for suspected illegal investment in the mainland.
UMC and Taiwan's Integrated Circuit Co., Ltd., also described Taiwan as a high-tech leading enterprise on the island.
Over the past year, the Taiwan authorities have been receiving great attention from all circles on the island for a series of investigations and actions against UMC.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 17 (Reporter Li Jie) the organizing committee of the second edition of "my heart in Macao" announced in Beijing on the 17th that all Chinese people in the world would be invited to participate in the competition.
The competition is jointly sponsored by the Macao Foundation and the Hundred Flowers Literary and Art Publishing House.
In 2004, on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of Macao's return to the motherland, the first "Macao in my heart" contest was held. The organizing committee received more than 8,000 entries, and more than 10 winners from both China and abroad were invited to the Macao Special Administrative Region to receive the awards.
The Macao SAR government decided to set the year 2006 as Macao's "World Cultural Heritage Year".
Wu chih-liang said that it was in this kind of good cultural atmosphere that the Macao Foundation and the Hundred Flowers and Art Publishing House decided to cooperate again to hold the second "Macao in my heart," to demonstrate the unique culture of Macao and the stability and prosperity of the SAR, and further establish a clear image of Macao's cultural city.

Shandong has successfully implemented an operation for the heart transplant of children and children.
Jinan, February 17 (Xinhua) The cardiovascular disease research institute of the Jinan Military Region has recently successfully carried out an operation to transplant the heart of infants and children.
At the intensive care ward on the 17th, the reporter saw that 51 days later the baby was covered with red, and all the monitoring and inspection indicators were normal, and he played with great interest the toys he bought from the health care workers.
According to a doctor who arrived at the hospital on the same day, the patient from Taian village, Shandong was sent to the hospital by his parents. He had difficulty breathing and was diagnosed with congenital heart disease and was required to carry out a heart transplant.
Heart transplant operation is the most difficult, the most risky, and the most complicated operation in heart surgery.
In particular, the heart transplant operation for children under one year of age is still a gap in the country.
An expert at the Institute of cardiovascular diseases in the Jinan Military Region has repeatedly argued that it has carefully designed the operation and the post-operation guardianship program, carried out independent innovations and carried out animal experiments.
The operation officially began at 8 a.m. on December 28, 2005.
The heart of the body is derived from the death of a dead baby, which was caused by congenital lung development.
The operation has to coincide with six blood vessels, with more than 500 stips, each of which does not exceed 3 mm.
After 295 minutes, the operation was a complete success.
China's General Administration of Supervision: containment of coal mines and other serious accidents are mostly sent to the top of this year's top priority.
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) The serious situation of national security production in the past year has made it the most important task of the National Security Council this year.
On the 17th, the reporter learned from the State Administration of Work Safety that it is necessary to really contain the extremely serious accidents such as coal mines, and that the coal mines are also heavy.
In view of the safety of coal mines this year, the SEPA will do a good job of the following three things:
-- Continue to win the battle of gas management.
In order to deal with the problem of gas, it is necessary to put it in a prominent position this year.
If the high gas mines are not implemented, they will have to be ordered to cut off immediately in accordance with the law.
-- continue to do a good job in rectifying and closing the battle.
It is necessary to treat the 5243 public notices that have already been announced to the public, plus the more than 700 coal mines that have recently been reported in various places.
It is necessary to keep the closure as a regular task, and constantly close down those coal mines that destroy resources, pollute the environment, and do not have security conditions.
-- strengthening the management of coal mine safety.
It is necessary to immediately rectify, put an end to the decline in the management of a small number of state-owned enterprises, and set up a standardized security management system for small mines that manage chaotic management.
In particular, it is necessary to pay attention to the key coal mines in the state, and absolutely not allow the production of excess capacity, overintensity, and overstaffing.
This year's safety production control Index requires that the number of deaths in all types of accidents in the country will drop by 3% compared with last year, of which the number of coal mines has dropped by 3.5%.
In a major accident with a death toll of more than 10 people, the number of accidents will drop by 5%, of which the number of coal mines has dropped by 7 percent.
These control indicators have been sent to the provincial people's governments, and all localities are breaking down and implementing them to grassroots units and enterprises.
The statistics show that in 2005 there were 5,986 deaths in coal mines in the country, a decrease of 0.7% compared to the same period last year.
However, there was a rise in the number of extremely serious accidents in which more than 10 people died, and the number of victims rose by 66.6% compared to the same period last year.
(international) Barroso called on all parties to compromise in Kosovo's future status talks
BELGRADE, February 17 (Xinhua) European Commission President Barroso said in Pristina, capital of Kosovo, that it is hoped that all parties concerned will make a compromise in the course of the future status negotiations in Kosovo and strive for the eventual establishment of a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo.
Barroso told the media on the same day that the relevant parties in Kosovo should adopt a tolerant attitude and establish a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo, a Kosovo that respects the ruling power of the government and protects the rights and interests of ethnic minorities.
He also stressed that the European Commission will do all it can to help the development of Kosovo.
Barroso also expressed concern over Kosovo's current difficulties in implementing the eight standards of the democratic process proposed by the United Nations.
In his view, the implementation of those standards was a key factor affecting the integration of Kosovo and Europe.
He also called on all Serbs in Kosovo to join the various institutions in order to make a positive contribution to the achievement of a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo.
Barroso arrived in Pristina, capital of Kosovo, on the same day for a one-day visit.
Prior to this, Barroso had already visited Croatia and Serbia. He will also visit Macedonia, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
(Winter Games. Stimulants) News analysis: There is a possibility that the incident may be shelved.
Turin, February 17 (Xinhua) there is a possibility that the incident will be shelved, according to a news analysis released here today.
Xinhua News Agency reporter Gao Peng
Although Italy has repeatedly said that athletes who were found to be using stimulants during the Winter Olympic Games may face "prison expenses," However, judging from various circumstances, this situation is unlikely to occur at the main role of the first batch of stimulants in this winter Olympic Games -- the two athletes from Russia in the winter.
The first stimulants scandal since the opening of the Winter Olympic Games on 16 May was found to have used a small number of prohibited drugs.
The next day, the International Olympic Committee announced that she had been expelled from the Winter Olympic Games, and that she had been deprived of her 15 km of men's silver medals during the Winter Olympic Games.
On the same day, the two unions of the international winter alliance made a decision to impose a penalty of two years on banned children.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has all along stipulated that athletes found to be using stimulants at the Olympic Games will be eliminated and disqualified from participating in the Games. However, they will not be subject to legal sanctions.
However, under Italian law, it is an offence for an athlete to carry and use stimulants, and the judiciary has the right to direct the arrest and investigation of athletes using stimulants, who also face imprisonment ranging from three months to three years.
In December last year, after a year of "bargaining," the IOC and the Italian government finally reached an agreement, and the two sides agreed to deal with the use of stimulants by athletes in accordance with Italian law during the Winter Olympic Games.
After the relentless efforts of the International Olympic Committee, the Italian side made a concession four days before the opening of the Winter Olympic Games. During the winter Olympic Games, the police would not enter the Olympic village to search for the athletes' location. However, athletes who are tested positive will still accept an investigation by the Italian prosecutor's office.
It has been reported that the official of the Italian government overseeing the Winter Olympic Games, pestant, has handed over to the procuratorial organs in Turin the incident.
The International Olympic Committee, however, has not yet confirmed this.
At noon on the 17th, the two teams of the Russian team for the winter in Russia revealed that they had left Turin and returned to the country.
Shi Kangcheng, a Chinese sports official who has served in the WADA for many years, believes that once he returns to China, the matter may eventually be "shelved."
Shi Kangcheng said: the IOC and the Italian government have never had a "thorough solution" on the issue of the Winter Olympic Games. Even if the Italian procuratorial organs are really involved in this matter, the results will be hard to tell.
According to previous Italian penalties for the use of stimulants by national athletes, the maximum penalty for the prohibited persons was no more than the "two-year suspended prison sentence".
As a result, the Italian anshakespeare senior reporter, piesri, said that the possibility of sending children into the prison was "minimal", and at most it was a fine.
Piesri also said that although the Italian court may hold a trial in absentia, the Italian police will not be able to go abroad to take him back to serve his sentence.
If Eva refused to accept the verdict, the Italian side also had nothing to do with it.
News Roundup: New epidemic outbreak continues to occur in various countries in the world
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 18 - according to a report by Xinhua News Agency, bird flu has further spread in the African continent.
The World Health Organization confirmed on the 17th that three regions in Egypt have found birds infected with the bird flu virus.
In Europe, France has also discovered the H5N1 bird flu virus for the first time. Europe and Africa are highly vigilant and have strengthened epidemic prevention measures.
The World Health Organization's regional adviser for the eastern Mediterranean, Hassan Bush, told the press on the 17th that currently there are dead birds infected with the H5N1 avian influenza virus in the three regions of Cairo, Gisenyi and the southern part of Egypt. The relevant departments of the Egyptian government have started to kill poultry suspected to be infected with bird flu.
Experts pointed out that Egypt is an important gateway for migratory birds in the Middle East and North Africa, and it is very likely that the avian flu virus will be brought into Hong Kong by migratory birds.
Egypt has declared a ban on the import of live poultry from abroad and has strengthened quarantine work at the border control points.
In the past week, more than 800 chickens died in a chicken farm in Yaound, the capital of Cameroon.
Cameroon has decided to immediately suspend the import of all poultry and pork from Nigeria, which has been affected by the avian flu epidemic, and to suspend trade in poultry and related products on all markets along the border between the two countries.
The government of Cameroon has also set up an epidemic monitoring network covering the entire territory within a short period of time. The basd Center and the state veterinary laboratory in the country are also in a state of emergency readiness to conduct laboratory tests on the H5N1 virus at any time.
In Europe, Denmark and Sweden initially ruled out the epidemic on the 17th.
The Swedish veterinary research institute has released the test results of the dead swans found on Wednesday, indicating that Swedish swans are not infected with the bird flu virus.
Preliminary tests by the Danish State Veterinary Administration also showed that the 30 dead swans found in Denmark recently were not infected with the bird flu virus.
But the agricultural sector says that Denmark cannot afford to take it lightly.
In Eastern Europe, there have been nine avian flu epidemic spots since the beginning of this year. World Health Organization experts said in Bucharest on the 17th that bird flu in almost all areas of the Danube delta region must be taken seriously. Romania may be under constant threat of bird flu in the next three or five years.
In Bangladesh in Asia, the government has taken all necessary measures to prevent avian flu.
The government's Livestock Services Council has provided relevant officials with books on bird flu prevention, while at the same time organizing training for poultry farmers.
(newspaper selection) China's first blood information management system completed in Zhejiang
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 18 - according to the blood center of Zhejiang Province, China's first shared blood information data management and control network system was officially completed and put into use in the center recently.
A relevant official from the blood center of Zhejiang Province said that this means that any citizen will have a unique code record in any one county (city or district) in Zhejiang Province to take part in blood donation.
The person in charge further explained that if the system shows that the period of free blood donation is not yet available through the entry of the relevant code records, it will indicate that it does not conform to the conditions of this blood donation.
This will not only protect the health of the blood donors themselves, but also effectively protect the health and safety of those who use them.
In addition, when the blood supply is tight, the blood donors and their relatives have priority in the use of blood. As long as you import the valid documents of the blood donors, you can immediately show the message of the blood donors, which is quite convenient.

Emergency evacuation of 11 villages in the Philippines in order to prevent recurrence of mountain landslides
MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) A local government official said today that 11 villages in the eastern part of the Philippines have been evacuated on an emergency basis in order to prevent the recurrence of similar landslides.
The village is located in the same area, with similar characteristics in the same area.
The residents of the 11 villages to be evacuated will be accommodated in seven evacuation centres.
Fras said: The government ordered the residents to withdraw yesterday, and today they sent people to inspect the villages because some people did not want to leave their homes.
On the 17th, the mountain landslides occurred in a village on the ground in the town of St. Bernard, Southern California, where soil and stones have buried the entire village, and only a few roofs can be seen.
Because the soil is very thick and the humidity is high, the hope that the people who are buried can survive is very slim.
At present, 109 people have been found dead and 57 others have been rescued.
It is estimated that the number of deaths caused by the accident may be as high as 1,800.
In the first month of this year, there was an increase of 35 2 percent over the same period last year.
Fuzhou, February 19 (Xinhua) China's foreign trade volume continued to grow at a rapid rate in January this year.
According to customs statistics, a total of 330 million US dollars was realized in Quanzhou in January, the best in history, an increase of 35.2 percent over the same period of last year, which is higher than the average increase in the province.
According to an analysis by the Quanzhou City Foreign Affairs Bureau, the reason for the rapid growth of the foreign trade in Quanzhou in January was mainly due to the increase in the enthusiasm of enterprises for export, the economic operation in Quanzhou, the strengthening of business confidence, and the efficient and smooth development of foreign trade.
There is hope that the champion will not be able to win the championship.
A love of life and love?
The gunpowder smoke in China is about to trigger off the flames of war.
Luneng is preparing for the battle for the new season, and is prepared to launch an attack again like the champion.
((PW)) the three strong interests of Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Shanghai are ready to break out at any time.
Who can seize the last championship.
According to the analysis of strength, although it is hoped that the Thai team will win the championship, it is not fully confident.
First of all, there should be a short break for the new players.
The Thai team had nothing to do last year.
This year the Thai team brought in the feet of Li Lei and Wang Liang. In the near future, two other foreign aid companies will join the team, which should be said to be increasing.
However, due to the competition between the national team and the Palestinian and Iraqi competitions, there was no need to cooperate with his teammates.
When they returned to the club, the league would have to fight.
Thus, the problem of adjustment has become the biggest problem faced by the Thai mountain team.
I think that in the first few rounds of the league elections, we could allow the feet to be used as a substitute.
First, we can take advantage of the training and adjustment team in the competition.
Secondly, we can let the players in the two national team matches take a break.
After a few rounds, the knife was finished, and it was not too late.
Second, there are hidden dangers in defense.
Last year, the defense of the Thai mountain team was criticized by fans.
This year, with the introduction of Li Lei, the defense has improved, but it has not yet come to rest.
The problem of the slow turning of the top guard still exists, and the replacement player is not too old or has a lack of experience.
If the Chinese side is able to play a stable role this year, then the Thai team will have an additional weight on the road to winning the championship.
I believe that if you do not have enough experience, you can do some training this year in order to prepare for the future.
In addition, Gao Yao will also do the same after he withdraws.
There were a lot of people in Thailand who were able to fight back, but Cui Peng and the waterfront were all able to fight.
Gao Yao's body is strong and fierce, and he should be able to be competent in his position as a rear guard.
Again, is it appropriate for foreign aid to adapt?
The issue of foreign aid has always been a major problem for the Thai team.
Last year, the performance of Tan Wei was not compliment.
We know that this year's foreign aid has not yet been selected.
I think that in addition to bringing in an excellent Vanguard this year, we should also introduce a pure left foot Avant.
In addition to the Xing Rui in the past few years, the Thai team still did not have a real right-hand man.
Even though Cui Peng and others are able to do well, one really is better than the other.
If these three problems can be resolved, the competition of the Thai mountain team should be more smooth.
As a Shandong fan, I very much hope that the Thai team can win the championship this year.
But in all honesty, the Thai team hopes that it will be very big but not big in the form of taking the championship this year.
If the hundred Emperor advertisements are incorporated into the jwt network, will it be too late for the new year?
Brandvista post:
Hello everyone.
The Spring Festival is once again behind us, and friends who combine holidays and Spring Festival holidays have returned to their posts one after another.
I wish all friends a happy new year. A happy new year is not too late.
That day, in a cafe with npln, he talked about the current brand names.
The website is much better.
The content of the content is quite good.
What makes him most fond of is the new comprehensive innovation based on discuz community BBS.
Speaking of the community, I have to thank one person.
That is Mr. Lee Ming-shun, general manager of discuz Beijing company.
You can find a pile of names in Google in search of his name.
It was probably known that he was engaged in new waves in the past. Later, he started his own business and set up an Internet advertising exchange platform similar to that of adbrite.com, a foreign company.
At that time, he debated with him on MSN, probably because he felt that the development of many industries in China was dependent on the growth of the private economy and small and medium-sized enterprises.
And now in the Chinese market, this kind of situation is not optimistic.
Therefore, both the creative industry and similar services for small and medium-sized enterprises will not be able to form a scale.
Charging higher fees for their own development will eventually lead to a cycle of uncertainty.
He later went to discuz.
Discuz is a very outstanding community process based on the PHP and mysql databases.
With the help of Beijing Technology Engineer ramboo, the brand geometric community finally came to light and became extremely bright.
It was a very good feedback.
The interface is clean and friendly,
It was quite fast.
I began to feel that it was a pleasure to write, under a clean and clean environment, written words that would enable oneself to understand and inspire others, and to exchange work and work with friends of the same industry.
Thank you!
Recently, there has been quite a lot of news about the advertising industry.
Starting from January, the WTO's system of opening up the advertising industry has begun to be implemented.
The big foreigner has already arrived at the scene, and the young people have come out with a knife, and it seems to be a scene of prosperity.
There are quite a lot of commercials that have emerged from Singapore.
After several heavy weight customers were lost in succession, with repeated setbacks in mainland China's development, Sir Martin finally took a bit of time from Italy's lawsuit to consider the reshuffle.
Batey will be integrated into the jwt network to retain the brand, which will be managed by jwt.
At the same time, there are also rumors that the Bates and 141 networks will soon be integrated into the orus system, under the management of the ogus advertising network.
Although it was previously reported that 141 had been reported to Austria, it was also an interesting thing for Austria and the United States to return to the United States.
During the Spring Festival, the website has updated several articles, and here we don't talk about them one by one.
If you have the time, you can allow the website to look at it.
At the same time, friends who have not yet entered the new forum may as well have a click of the mouse to enter the brand new community.
Feel the environment, experience the atmosphere, and contribute some words.
I hope I can feel the joy of finding an organization.
I wish all our friends a beautiful mood.
Good luck!

Let's take a look at this article.
This is not an urge to read, but rather the warmth and kindness of the heart.
If you want to do it myself,
The answer is very clear. I will put down the phone and "you are wrong".
This year, I have been thinking about what we should do to help others.
Temporary acts, such as donations, have been abandoned.
A friend said two days ago that I had no time to take care of myself. Those who helped them were only willing and unable to do so.
I wish you a happy day:)

The mother of ten years ago
It was one day ten years ago when the teacher was making use of the noon break, when he was sleeping at home, suddenly the telephone rang.
When she came over, she heard an unfamiliar and violent voice: "your home has been stolen by your child. Now we are caught by US, you come here soon!"
There was also a cry of cry from a little girl in the microphone, as well as the voice of the people on the side of the side.
She looked back and looked at the only daughter who was watching television at the same time, and she immediately understood it.
There was no doubt that there was a little girl who was caught by a salesman and refused to let his family know about it. Therefore, Hu created a telephone number, which happened to be a hit.
Of course, she can put down the phone and even condemn the other party.
Because this incident has nothing to do with her.
However, I am a teacher. Maybe she is his own student.
Through the phone, she could set up an idea. The little girl, who was in bad shape, must be scared and scared. She was facing perhaps the most frightening situation in his life.
After a moment of hesitation, her mind suddenly appeared in her mind. Yes, it was done.
Therefore, after she asked about the address of the bookstore, she rushed over.
As she expected, there was a little girl with tears in the bookstore.
The people next to them were loudly denouncing them.
She rushed up and held the poor little girl in his arms and turned around and said, "Don't tell me what to say to me. Don't scared the child."
She was forced to pay a fine of several tens of dollars before she came out with a fine of several tens of dollars. She walked out of the bookstore and took a look at the face of his tears and terror, which made her face a mess.
She smiled and took the little girl to her home, cleaned it up, did not ask anything, and asked the little girl to leave.
When she was about to leave, she made a special effort to tell him that if you read books, she would come here to have a lot of books here.
The little girl, who had not yet done so, had a deep look at her and had to fly in the usual way, and he never showed up again.
As time went by in a hurry, there was no doubt that during the ten years, there was an interval of ten years.
She has already forgotten about this matter and is still living here, living in a peaceful and peaceful life.
One day at noon, there was a knock at the door.
When she opened the door, she saw a young and beautiful girl with a smile on his face. He also held a large pile of gifts in his hand.
"Who are you looking for?
"She asked ((PW)),
The girl was excited and said a whole bunch of words.
Finally, she finally found out from the description of the unknown girl that she was a little girl in those years. After 10 years, she had successfully graduated from college and was now making a special trip to visit him.
This young girl, with tears in his eyes, said, "even though I still don't understand, why do you want to impersonate my mother and rescue me? But I always feel that I've always wanted to call you" Mama "over the past ten years."
The teachers, in their eyes, also started to wrap them up.
She asked, "what will happen if I do not help you that day?"
As soon as the girl's face became dark, he shook her head, saying, "I'm not sure, maybe I will do stupid things, or even die."
The teacher suddenly shook his mind and began to feel happy.
The decision made by myself at that time could actually have an impact on a person's life.
Looking at the happy smile on the face of the girl, she smiled together.

Who wants to do this? Well, congratulations, he can become a Buddha at an early date.

Military intelligence observation: How long can Iran stay under air raid by the US military?
Yun Fei Chuen
If the traditional consumer war is compared to the death of a competitor, then the modern war will be a shot at the head of an opponent, so that it will become a "vegetative state" when it is too late.
The gap between the military capabilities of Iran and the United States is not quantitative, but rather an understanding of modern warfare.
Iran, which has no distinction with Iraq during the eight years of war, does not seem to have read the true meaning of modern high-tech war.
After analyzing the deployment of the US military, the British "international intelligence review" recently pointed out that the US military is preparing to launch a large-scale air strike against Iran....
The current situation of the Iranian air force is worrying.
The current situation of the Iranian air force is similar to that of the Iraqi air force before the war in 2003.
Our country does not have the ability to develop modern weapons independently, and is also subject to a Western arms embargo.
Once the war breaks out, it is very questionable whether the aging aircraft of the Iranian air force can be launched into space with the US military.
At present, the Iranian air defense system is mainly composed of the air and air defense forces of the Iranian regular army, the air defense forces and the Revolutionary Guard.
Among them, the Iranian air force has approximately 50,000 troops and has over 300 combat planes of various types.
The main models include the F-4 "Ghost", the F-5 "Tiger", the F-14s "Kaohsiung cat" and the Russian Mig-29, and so on.
The ground air defense units are mainly equipped with "hog", British "light sword" and some Russian "Sam" missiles.
In his analysis of the current situation of Iran's air defense forces, United States military expert harrodrigues hukisen, the military expert of the Russian Institute of political and military analysis, Herat, and others analyzed that, judging from the current situation, there are still loopholes in the building of the Iranian air defense capability and the construction of the air defense system.
Hu chisen believes that as far as overall strength is concerned, the Iranian air force and the US military basically are not on a par.
The large number of U.S. military planes equipped with Iranian equipment cannot be used because of a lack of spare parts and promotion.
Up until now, only more than 10 fighter jets, who have been regarded as the trump card of the Iranian air force, have been able to launch off into the sky.
It is also doubtful that the actual combat reliability of the AIM-54 "non-dead bird" missile, which is alleged to have the capability of an ultra-visual attack, is also called into question.
Herat pointed out that the air defense missile system provided by the United States to Iran in the 70s of the last century has lost its combat capability due to the lack of spare parts.
And some other non-systematic air defense weapons obtained from Russia and other countries are not in a position to deal with US troops with strong electromagnetic confrontation capabilities.
Fighting combat effectiveness on the east side of the East
The Iranian government is clearly aware of the fact that its fate in the war is determined by the fact that it is able to keep the sky above its head, and to strengthen its air defense system.
At present, the approach can be summed up in two ways:
In the first place, major nuclear facilities are being vigorously concealed to strengthen their combat capability.
According to a report by the times of the United Kingdom, Iran has hidden the core components of nuclear facilities such as the Natanz nuclear plant and the Isfahan uranium enrichment center at a depth of 18 meters deep, plus a 2-meter thick concrete protective shell.
However, as early as 1991, during the Gulf War, the US military saw the effectiveness of underground bunkers in the battle against air strikes, and carried out surprise research and development of all kinds of bombs.
After more than 10 years of targeted research, the US military has now put in place a set of tactics and weapons to deal with underground reinforced bunkers.
Iran has also recently purchased a large amount of advanced air defense weapons from Russia.
Since the end of last year, the Iraqi government and Russia have successively entered into a series of 29 "Daur" air defense missile systems with a value of US $700 million.
However, modern warfare is a contest between the system and the system.
All kinds of air raid weapons of the US military have been developed independently by their own countries. Moreover, after years of actual combat, they have been transformed into a highly effective war machine.
Whether or not Iran's "new weapons" from the east of another country can create combat strength or problems in such a short period of time.
The gap in Iran is not only on weapons.
The "Platform for Action" published by the US military in 1982, for the first time, put forward the idea of "an open space battle," stressing that the enemy's strategic depth should be hit by air superiority. At the beginning of the war, the enemy's command system could only become "the meat on the cutting board."
In the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 Kosovo war and the Iraq war in 2003, the US military did not care about how many planes there were, but rather the range of their own "Tomahawk" cruise missiles.
Although the Iranian government is already preparing for possible air strikes and has begun to take measures to strengthen its air defense capability, it seems that Iran, which has no distinction with Iraq during the eight years of war, does not know the true meaning of the modern high-tech war.
As the US military has made progress in military restructuring in recent years, the US military air raids are completely different from the carpet bombing during the Vietnam war. Instead, they rely on all kinds of high-tech weapons to rely on the high precision and depth of the modern information technology.
In the face of such air strikes, it is still unknown how long the Iranian ground air defense system can sustain.

According to Koizumi,......
Did it join hands with Google, Microsoft, to collect "overhead fees" from software manufacturers?
Yun Fei Chuen
Dell Dell Inc. (US; Dell) and Google confirmed on Tuesday that Dell company is testing the personal computers installed in Google's software package.
This move may pose a serious threat to Microsoft's dominant position in the personal computer software market.
Dell, a spokesman for Dell, said that the company is assessing Google's software.
With the installation of the software, personal computer users can use the software to conduct searches on the Internet, as well as to search for information stored on personal computers.
Blackburn confirmed that the software currently tested by the company includes Dell's home page supported by Google, Google's desktop search system and Google tool column.
Meanwhile, Google's spokesman Jon murchinson also confirmed that the company is testing a batch of Google development software together with Dell.
Prior to this, the Wall Street Journal reported that it began negotiations with Dell and Hewlett Packard Co., etc., in an attempt to convince these computer manufacturers to install Google's software in the computer.
According to an internal source quoted by The Wall Street Journal, in order to achieve this goal, Google may pay Dorda billion US dollars in the next three years.
However, the two companies did not disclose the relevant details.
In addition, HP has refused to make any comment.
Microsoft news spokesperson neilcharney refused to comment on the above news.
Currently, Microsoft is planning to introduce a search tool for the next generation of Windows operating system and to strengthen the development of online business.
On the day of the announcement, Google's stock prices fell again by 4.46% to US $367.92.
On the same day, the stock price of Microsoft dropped by 1% to US $26.94.
Some analysts pointed out that Google is anxious to find the direction of expansion outside the network search and that the joining of PC magnates such as Dell may prompt Google to threaten the core business of Microsoft.
Marketing research company directions on Microsoft analyst Matt Rosoff said that Google is anxious to expand its new source of income, which is absolutely the concern and worry of Microsoft.
But some analysts do not think so.
Market Analysis company Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Charles Di Bona pointed out that it is still too early for Google to assume the ruling position of Microsoft Windows.
Reporter: does Google relax the land of Microsoft?
Mr Hui Wai-ching, JP
Computers have undoubtedly become a necessity for modern people to live and work.
However, at the same time when we are skilled in computer operations, only a small number of people understand the working principles of computers.
Just like using a "fool" camera, as long as the interface is friendly and the most convenient software is used, the vast majority of "vegetable birds" can still play the black box.
As a result, the software packages for PC producers will often determine the usage habits of the majority of consumers.
It is through this measure that Microsoft has a firm grasp of the personal computer operating system market.
Now, Microsoft's new opponent Google also intends to take a share of the pie through this method.
Taiwan's well-known economic media have recently made an interesting analogy.
"Dell and Hewlett Packard and other computer manufacturers have started to treat their computers as supermarket shelves and charge the software companies' fees. '
The winners will be able to enable their software to emerge within the 'critical 10 minutes' of the users' introduction of new computers, and guide consumers to use their products.
This mode of charging is like a supermarket which collects fees from the food traders, "he said.
There is no doubt that this phenomenon shows that Microsoft's control power is easing.
Microsoft's managers warn Gates (bill g a Te) that if G. O G L begins to pay to the personal computer manufacturer that the computer will be equipped with the software of G O G L E, then the hegemony of Microsoft will eventually be threatened.
No matter what the final outcome may be, it is likely that Microsoft will be able to sit down and sit down for the first time in history.
After all, it is easy to fight.
There is no such thing as a major event in the world.

The sword of Justice: looking ahead to 2006
Author: the sword of justice
I remember that at the beginning of 2005, the Hong Kong Apple Daily published an article entitled "The frequent transfer of France to the enemy."
It is stated in the article that 2004 is a year in which Falun Gong has entered into a fierce competition.
The article states that Communist China's overseas officials have completely lost their lives in various occasions, while Falun Gong practitioners have lost their face in all parts of the world, and so on and so forth.
However, it seems that the "nine commentaries" caused by the "nine commentaries" in 2005 are very magnificent, and it seems that they have nothing to say in 2004.
Then, what will happen in 2006?
From the two events that took place early this year, we can see some signs of this year's development.
One was the "evil forces" published by the founder of Falun Gong. This article sentenced the end of the Chinese Communist agents to the end of 1999.
For this article, perhaps many people will doubt or cannot believe it.
However, no matter if you don't believe it, history and facts will prove!
Of course, Chinese Communist agents seem to be living in the dark trench.
Their "natural or unexpected" death will not cause social and public concern.
However, the vast area of Chinese Communist agents at home and abroad is bound to have a powerful impact and shock on the CPC's power class!
Under the deterrent effect of Heaven, they will have to think seriously about their own way of retreat and survival - from leaving the party to the party.
From this, the "super stable bureaucratic system of the Chinese Communist Party," which is maintained by dirty interests, will begin to shake, collapse, and collapse!
There is one more thing, that is, the hunger strike campaign launched by Gao Zhiyi.
This sudden and unexpected move unexpectedly received a warm response from all over the world, as well as a common response from people from all walks of life and from all sides.
If this operation can become a link between the righteous forces of all parties and the suffering people, and make them large, then the external forces that will be the last blow to the CCP's criminal regime, which is in a precarious situation, will be expected to take shape.
If 2005 is to be destroyed at the spiritual level, then 2006 will enter the stage where the spiritual and material dimensions are eliminated at the same time.
With the further spread of the "nine commentaries" and the in-depth advancement of the tide of withdrawal from the party, the collapse of the CCP itself and the cohesion of the righteous forces of the Foreign Ministry, the life of the demon of the Communist Party of China will officially enter the countdown period!
The aspirations of the people of God have been integrated, and the strength of the gods is coming together.
The sword is directed at the demon of the Communist Party of China.
If the year 2004 is a year of high singing, 2005 will be a magnificent year. What will be the conclusion of 2006?
I hope it will be a tremendous change, a triumphant return!
The crime of degeneration
Yes, there are problems!
How come I didn't stop at all?
If you want to send it again, I will treat you as a rubbish!

Xu Zhiyong: a letter to Li Gang, secretary of the Provisional Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.
France
Poster: sunnypaku (sunny),
Area: square
Title: Xu Zhiyong: a letter from Li Gang, secretary of the Provisional Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China -- an outlawed act will hurt you.
Poster's site: (wed Feb 8 13: 56: 14 2006), this site (yjrg.net)
As of yesterday, the provisional government under your leadership has kept Chen Guangcheng illegally under house arrest for 165 days.
You, chairman of the Association, have illegally imprisoned a legitimate citizen who is blind to the eyes of the blind.
You cut off the telephone line of his house and put on a cell phone interference device in his yard.
You also beat him and his family several times.
Your barbaric acts have crossed the bottom line of civil society.
In early October 2005, you used an outlawed triad method to beat me and Li Fang, but we were patient. We always understood your difficulties as much as possible, and even acquiescence in your house arrest for a period of time.
However, 165 days have passed, and you have not stopped.
You dispatched members of the brigade police and thugs to harass the villagers.
You continue to arrest and beat the villagers.
You have done too much!
Today, at a time when you continue to organize the suppression of triad societies around Chen Guangcheng, I would like to remind you clearly that the means of triad societies will in turn harm you yourself.
You should reflect on the matter from the very beginning.
Provisional family planning took first place in the whole province.
As the secretary of the municipal party committee, you are somewhat anxious. This is understandable.
However, it would be wrong for you to think that the poor quality of a person can only be enforced by force in order to enforce the state's legal policy.
Is it true that citizens do not cooperate with the actions of the government?
Is it because the quality of the citizens is poor, or is it because the government has long had too many lies that have caused too much credibility?
If it is said that the same government behavior 10 years ago was not so absurd, by 2005, in Chinese society, there has been tangible progress in the protection of human rights, which has been enshrined in the constitution. Don't you think that your barbaric behavior is too outrageous?
Why don't you reflect on this? Why do you only dare to do it this way?
How can it be that you do not have the means to enforce the law by means of democracy and the rule of law?
After Chen Guangcheng and a group of brave citizens reported brutal law enforcement, in Teng Biao and other lawyers who were courageous enough to defend the rights of citizens, following the conclusion of the investigation by the State Family Planning Commission, Linyi city could have made a sincere explanation for the public's understanding.
After all, family planning is a difficult issue with Chinese characteristics.
We can all appreciate your difficulties.
However, you have taken a further absurd move by taking Chen Guangcheng back from Beijing and trying to give him an offence of illegally supplying the state secret intelligence.
Don't you think that this accusation is a famine for a person who is blind to the vision of a poor mountain village?
In fact, as long as you really correct the mistakes, as long as you do a very good job, are you still afraid of being criticized by a blind person?
It is necessary for you to send dozens of people to take care of him 24 hours a day, so that he may even be guilty of a crime?
On October 4, 2005, my lawyer Li Fang and I went to the east lion village. We expressed a very clear position and hoped to resolve the contradictions.
We proposed that we could discuss with your officials first and see what your thoughts and requests are.
We took the initiative to suggest that we could help you to persuade Chen Guangcheng and persuade him not to say anything.
We hope that you will not treat a blind person like this, and both sides should make some concessions.
However, your decision makers are bent on having their own way, and they have actually carried out a "careful planning" - beating and illegally detaining US.
Do you think this will deter us?
We have not done anything illegal.
We have no fear.
Although the rule of law in China is not perfect, there is still no rule of law.
You think that by means of an outlawed triad society, you can scare us, and you have greatly underestimated our determination and perseverance.
As long as we are willing, many of us have many legitimate reasons to deal with it or to visit Chen Guangcheng.
You can beat lawyers and scholars one, two or three times, and each time there will be extensive attention and coverage.
Do you really dare to beat us 10 times?
Aren't you very concerned about your official position?
Some people have really been injured and your position is so strong?
Don't listen to our rational advice, but on the contrary, do you think that it is very foolish and dangerous to do so?
I want to tell you clearly that in China there is a large number of outstanding citizens loyal to the rule of law.
We are not afraid of triad societies.
We cannot tolerate gross violations of the bottom line of human civilization.
If you are doing too much, we will pick up a group of people with their sticks and self-confidence and calmly go up till the moment when you are back.
You should know clearly that it is not a good thing for you to use an outlaw triad society.
Don't think that if you are hiding behind the scenes, you can get rid of the cadres who beat the villagers and get out of the department.
In conclusion, I would like to remind you to be sincere.
A person who was blind in childhood, graduated from the School of Chinese medicine, studied law and English, sued the Beijing Subway Company for the benefit of the blind, and brought water to the villagers and became a well-known "Chen lawyer."
You actually mobilized an unscrupulous person to slander him on the Internet, and tried to provide him with a crime of illegally providing secret intelligence to the outside world. Do you think that you are going too far?
Your house arrest is illegal, and it is dangerous for you.
You could have completely released him.
Since the act of brutal law enforcement has come to an end, how long can he criticize him?
However, you are constantly destroying your image today.
As long as Chen Guangcheng does not have freedom, you will not be in peace for a day.
It has been enough for you to torture him.
We will never stand idly by if we still want to convict him or to resort to further means of outlaw.
Citizen Xu Zhiyong, February 8, 2006
(FW) does the Chinese nation enjoy democracy?
To explore the path of China's peaceful liberation, so as to promote the liberation of our people.
I am very disappointed to admit that the Chinese nation is not worthy of democracy!!!
The people who posted here are not doing this kind of thing!
It is a pity that there are not many people on the Internet (compared with 1.4 billion).
The number of people on the Internet who are concerned about and participating in such topics is even less: I dare to assert that it is less than 1% of the number of people on the Internet!
What's more, this network has the largest, the most comprehensive, the most advanced, the most expensive, and the best quality Golden Shield Project in the world!
Indeed.
Frustrated, disappointed, helpless, and even willing to give in, other than relying on one's own efforts, one can still count on whom.
Even if I don't try to get things done, I will feel that if I don't work hard for my ideals, then I will think that I am wrong. I live the same life as a dog.
Striving for justice will in itself add a piece of beauty to your own life, at least in my own heart, and in my own assessment of himself.
In fact, I don't have to worry about the future of China.
Because the world's environment can no longer allow the existence of a long-term non-elected regime.
It is only a matter of time.
He only sighed with feeling that the Chinese nation was very lucky. It was always the path to the hell of a world-class great man at the turning point of history. It turned out to be a glorious beach with a pile of white bones on the road. It also forced us to be proud of this kind of glory.
During the night of darkness, China was the longest.
The people of the Republic of China and the Republic of China have suffered a great deal.
The emperor of the Qin Dynasty was in a state of violence, and the Saint was in the dark.
The Chinese are not worthy of democracy. They have no democratic genes, and they have all been degraded.
For a country that has been in existence for more than three years, if there is a democratic factor in its national culture, that country has long been democratic.
When the democratic system was established in Athens, when the British adopted the grand charter, when the French made the declaration of human rights, when the Americans issued the declaration of independence, what did the Chinese do?
In front of the central plain of the Chinese People's Republic of China, when the emperor was elected to the central plain, there was an early parliamentary election of the Minister of State. Why did he go to the Han district to take part in the affairs of the Han nationality?
The Chinese people seek material information and have no interest in spiritual beliefs and political rights.
If you don't believe, the Chinese must have universal suffrage and the pie can be sold to you.
Half a million years later, if the Chinese want democracy, then there must be an earthquake, and you can run and run.

Dalai's special envoy held a closed-door meeting with Chinese officials

Dalai's special envoy held a closed-door meeting with Chinese officials
The Dalai Lama stressed that he hoped for Tibet's autonomy and not independence.
The special envoy of the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, is holding a closed-door meeting with Chinese officials in Beijing, and the details have not been announced.
This is the fifth formal meeting since the resumption of contacts between the governments of China and the Dalai in 2002.
However, as in the past, the two sides held meetings behind closed doors and the details were not disclosed.
The reporter said that the two sides have held numerous talks, but no substantial results have been achieved so far.
The Dalai Lama, who was in exile in northern India, said that he hoped for Tibet's autonomy rather than independence.
The Chinese side refused to comment on the talks between the two sides.
However, analysts say Beijing hopes the dialogue between the two sides will be due in part to concerns that if the 70-year-old spiritual leader dies, this may lead to a rise in Tibetans' dissatisfaction with the Chinese rule.
Cultural identity
The delegation of the Dalai's government in exile was led by Gallo Lozhu, who was also the chief representative of the previous rounds of talks.
A spokesman for the Tibetan government said that the talks between them and Chinese officials in Switzerland in 2005 were very "close and candid," which brought hope to Tibetans.
The spokesman said that their ultimate hope is to resolve the related problems with the Chinese leadership in accordance with the basis of negotiations, so that Tibetans can have freedom and maintain the cultural identity that they consider to be important.
CGP Pui
The special envoy of the Dalai Lama reiterated that he would not seek independence from Tibet.
Dalai Lama to visit Washington this month
Prior to the visit of the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, to the United States on 8 November, his special envoy said that the Tibetan government in exile did not demand the independence of Tibet.
Zhu Rongji said in Washington that he hoped the Chinese government would really protect Tibet's unique culture and traditions.
It is expected that during his visit to the United States next week, the Dalai Lama will discuss the Tibet issue with President Bush and hope that Bush will urge the Chinese government to give Tibet genuine autonomy.
The representatives of the Dalai and Beijing officials made direct contacts in Berne for the first time in July this year.
"genuine autonomy"
He pointed out that during the talks between the Tibetan government and the Chinese authorities over the past few years, the Tibet government and the Chinese authorities have seen some positive aspects.
The special envoy of the Dalai Lama found that Beijing leaders, especially representatives of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, were more willing to listen to their views than in the past.
However, he said that there are still too many differences between the Tibetan government and the Chinese government, and the positions of the two sides are very different.
He said that over the past five years, the Tibetan government in exile has tried its best to respond to China's request to create a good environment for negotiations.
China should also create a good environment for negotiations on the Tibet issue, and should not blindly suppress the Dalai Lama.
He said that the Dalai Lama does not demand Tibet independence, Tibet is still a part of China, but the Chinese government must preserve the unique culture of Tibet and "allow Tibetans to have genuine autonomy."
On the other hand, he pointed out that some Chinese people think that as long as the Dalai Lama dies, the Tibet issue will disappear.
He said that this idea is very dangerous because once the Dalai Lama is not there, China will lose a historic opportunity to resolve the Tibet issue.
He said that as long as the Chinese government responds to the demands made by the Dalai Lama and proposes a final solution, the Dalai Lama will no longer need to talk about the Tibet issue at the international level.
Negotiation and compromise are important means of democracy! (ZT)
Hau Wah
Just now, in the 'healthy spirit', we saw a net friend's message.
He (she) said that "negotiation and compromise is an important means of democracy. Otherwise, because of the lack of convergence of opinions, it will be a failure of democracy!!" I hope that the Democrats will pay full attention to this. "
This simple remark did not arouse the interest of any net friend, which caused me to think about it, and my feelings were full of emotion.
At that time, I thought of the ancient China. I also thought of the West.
I could not help but to restore the message of the net friend with the main stick.
Let's take a look at the ancient China.
As we all know, China has built a unified central authority for the Qin Dynasty, and all subsequent dynasties have been operating under this political framework.
Although the Han Dynasty has implemented the "dual-track system" for the time being, it is a political system parallel to the dual system of centralized system and centralized system. In the end, it came to an end with a centralized system.
The result of this centralized decentralization has its advanced side under the historical conditions of the time and has the party that promotes the development of the productive forces.
However, we should also note that the result of this system, which has been operating for more than two decades, has led to a lack of creativity, initiative and initiative on the part of the local community.
The pyramid rule system has also caused junior officials to look at them only to the upper level.
Since the local officials of the county government are appointed by the central government, there is no room for coordination and negotiation, not to mention the ordinary people.
When the rights of ancient Chinese farmers were infringed upon, they could only tolerate it.
Only when the most basic rights are threatened, that is, when large areas of hunger, tyranny, and the deprivation of the right to life as a result of natural disasters, are exposed,
In the past 2,000 years, the peasants' uprising, which has been swept across the country, has never been premeditated.
Even in this way, the Ming Dynasty, initiated by Chu Yuan-chang, is no more than the replacement of other dynasties, and there is no change in the system.
Zhu Yuanzhang, who has no culture at all, has kept the ancient Chinese totalitarian system in a state of illness, playing to the limit. From then on, it lost the life of the Tang Dynasty, which was free and tolerant.
The air of freedom of speech once disappeared on the land of China.
Human nature has been subjected to the greatest repression.
Everyone is careful and cautious, and dare not talk more about it.
This is the result of the victory of the only peasant uprising in 2000. At one time, it made the Chinese people no longer a ghost.
Now let's take a look at the middle ages, known as the dark era in western Europe.
The Western European century was formed after the destruction of western Rome by the nomadic peoples of ancient Greece, which had nothing to do with the past thousands of years in ancient Greece.
This era is characterized by separation, that is, the distribution of land.
The land leaders at various levels have more independent powers.
Whether it is a few kilometers or a few kilometers, the men and the nobility who can appear on the table are able to exercise checks and balances, check each other and rely on each other, and have the ability to fight for their own rights with the King, thus creating a scene of talks between the nobleman and the King in ancient China for the sake of their own interests.
Compromise and compromise with each other, and not replace the other with violent means.
In this way, the rights of the nobility and civilians are increasingly delegated to the nobility and the civilians through the formulation of various contracts, the rights of the nobility and the civilians are increasing, and the rights of the King are getting smaller and smaller.
It was only later that the Queen was placed in a place with no real power.
This is the gradual realization of democracy!
On the other hand, when all the powers are concentrated in the hands of the Emperor (with the exception of Li Shimin), it is very difficult for the peasants to sit at the negotiating table for a pot of tea and a cup of wine.
In this situation, when the right to life is denied, only violent means can be used to overthrow the present dynasty and try to replace it.
The result was repeated rotation, from the peak of the Tang Dynasty to the disease of the Ming Dynasty.
Compared to the history of East and West, we find that there seems to be no conflict between ancient Chinese and ancient Chinese rulers and rulers in ancient China.
No Western country, such as that in ancient China, has experienced a lot of peasants' uprising.
When there were contradictions between the ancient royal families and peasants in western countries, the nobility and the civilians first thought that their interests would be resolved through negotiation, and that they would gradually gain more rights through negotiation, and rarely resort to violence.
It is understood that when we enter the 21st century, the Internet will still see some Democratic activists who are genetically engineered by the Ming Dynasty's super absolute totalitarian system.
Also because the toxins of the Cultural Revolution were eroding their flesh, they would not say anything other than down and down.
This concept is the greatest obstacle to democracy, because they do not understand that negotiation and compromise are the most important means and means to achieve democracy.
Cao Xiaoming rich in cultural activities in rural areas. Who is going to "pay the bill"?
Hau Wah
This year during the Spring Festival, this author was privileged to go to the mainland's countryside for the new year and visited some relatives and friends.
While they are infected with a rich new year in China's countryside, they are also worried about the boring cultural activities in the rural areas.
The author found in a village of friends and relatives that in previous years, every year during the Spring Festival, the village had to organize the villagers to play a local film called "go-round."
This film was based on the figures of three countries. The adults and children could play a role in the theater, and the villagers knew nothing about it.
In the village, there are several teams, not only in this village, but also in other villages.
However, this year the village has not been organized again.
It turns out that a big sum of money would have to be spent on getting out of the show. In the past, it was the villagers who raised money and bought them. Now, this outfit can no longer be worn.
They went from door to door and asked the villagers to offer money, and everyone was unwilling, and a similar situation occurred in several other villages in the township.
There was no "spinning signal", and the village got desolate all of a sudden.
The adults started playing mahjong.
The child also played a paper card.
The villagers all said that they had nothing to do during the past year.
Besides lighting firecrackers, playing mahjong, it has also become a big landscape for the rural new year.
On the other hand, the trend of gambling has not been stopped again and again, and there is a tendency to spread. As a result, a total of 10,000 yuan has become common. In particular, a large number of returning farmers who work in the city have become the main characters in casinos.
I earned all the hard money I earned in a year.
As a result, family disputes arising from gambling have occurred from time to time, and some have even caused the tragedy of family destruction.
Some farmers said that not only do they have gambling money for the new year, they often take part in gambling when they are idle.
If you don't gamble, then there is no place to go.
It is extremely difficult to find some cultural activities in the rural areas and to find some "joy".
There was not only a lack of facilities and funds, but there was no organization.
In this regard, Jiangxi's approach was undoubtedly a blessing for the farmers.
The Jiangxi provincial government, in order to enrich the cultural life of the peasants, has not only implemented the "government funding, market operation, market operation, and farmers' watch" since September of last year.
Each year, at least 60 million yuan of special funds for rural culture will be arranged to deliver quality cultural products to the rural people.
At the beginning of the new year, there was an additional investment of 40 million yuan, bringing in a total of 100 million yuan to set up a special fund for rural culture.
In addition, the "bills" that use this special fund to "buy" the peasants are also very beneficial:
A variety of professional arts and performance groups are invited to perform in rural areas, and not less than four in every town every year;
Film companies at all levels are invited to organize screening teams to show films in rural areas. Each administrative village does not have less than six feature films and science films per year;
It is organized to carry out mass cultural activities with local characteristics, not less than two to three times a year.
From this "purchase list", it is not difficult for us to see that the government is not trying to pay for the money. Instead, it has done a great deal of work on how to put the limited funds on the knife.
At present, the vast number of farmers are happy to enjoy the "imperial grain tax" in order to avoid handing over the "imperial grain tax."
If the government could "pay the bill" for the enrichment of the cultural activities of the peasants as it did in Jiangxi, it would be a blessing for the farmers.
This "joy" will not only enable the peasants to free themselves from the mahjong table, but also "move" in cultural activities, and also add tiles to the building of a new socialist countryside.
It was a false alarm for Wang Peirong's children to be kidnapped.

It was a false alarm for Wang Peirong's children to be kidnapped.
At 9: 00 p.m. on January 24, 2006, Wang Peirong's children gave a full account of:
On the morning of January 24, 2006, Wang Peirong's child took up the physics class of the third class in Xuzhou, and was called out by the entrance guards.
Entrance guards said to Wang Peirong's children: three unidentified men were unable to go home for three days because Wang Peirong's children are not as good as the parents of Wang Peirong's children.
Now her mother is missing. We are the leader of her mother's unit and want to join Wang Peirong's children in three ways.
Wang Peirong's child and gateway: these three men were all fake, and did not agree to go with the three men.
With the help of third door guards, Wang Peirong's children were not taken away.
Wang Peirong's child called her mother's leadership to verify the matter at noon, and the leader denied that he had sent someone to three places in Xuzhou.
Wang Peirong's children have to go to her father's leading telephone number from her.
Wang Peirong's child made a phone call to her father.
The child of Wang Peirong said, "there are three in three people who want to take me away."
The leader asked, "why don't you follow them?"
Wang Peirong's child answer: I have decided to die with them.
When he finished talking about Wang Peirong's child, he hung up the phone.
After listening to the children of Wang Peirong, he felt the situation was serious, and Wang Peirong reported the case to the police.
On January 25, the feedback from the police station was basically true of Wang Peirong's children.
The police station asked whether the mine safety department sent someone to go to the center to look for Wang Peirong's children. The answer was no.
The police station once again asked whether the subordinate units of the coal mine safety department sent people to the center to look for Wang Peirong's children, and there was no reply either.
Through others, the authorities concerned asked Wang Peirong and his family to pay attention to safety.
After the incident occurred, the leaders of the Xuzhou municipal departments attached great importance to it.
The investigation department of the Xuzhou Ministry of Public Security ruled out the possibility of kidnapping children.
Wang Peirong expressed thanks for the leadership of the Xuzhou Ministry of Public Security and the investigation department of the Xuzhou Ministry of Public Security.
This is a false alarm, and the main reason for the false alarm may be in the third form.
The investigation department of the Xuzhou Ministry of Public Security now discovered that on January 24, Wang Peirong, head of the College of Sciences, was unable to find Wang Peirong because he did not know anything, and asked Wang Peirong to ask Wang Peirong to ask Wang Peirong, who was not in Xuzhou.
Heavy topic: Why is it that the risk of corruption is relatively low, while the cost of fighting corruption is higher instead.
Http: / / bbs.people.com.cn/ BBS / readfile? whichfie = 4496 & typeid = 39
The current cadre mechanism and anti-corruption mechanism, the corrupt officials have to worry about those officials who are in charge of him, and not the vast majority of the people.
Therefore, once he finds that he has successfully deceived or settled those officials who can influence his fate, he can rest assured of the great cause of corruption and enrichment, and can ignore the feelings of the people in close proximity.
On the contrary, those ordinary people who do not have the right to fight against corruption in their hands may lead to extremely brutal retaliation.
Or they are still being held in a political hat, so that they are at a loss as to how to die before they die.
Comparing the two, the risks of corruption are relatively low, while the costs of fighting corruption are higher instead.
