ANC opposes sanctions against Zimbabwe
JOHANNESBURG, March 18 (Xinhua) The South African National Congress (ANC), the South African National Congress (ANC), today criticized the United States, Britain, and other Western countries in an attempt to force Zimbabwe to act according to the will of the Western countries.

Foreign Ministry spokesman on the report adopted by the European Parliament
In response to a reporter's question today, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue made a comment on a report passed by the European Parliament.
A reporter asked: On 11 April, the plenary session of the European Parliament considered and adopted the "Report of the European Parliament on the European Commission's China strategy paper."
What is China's comment on this?
Zhang Qiyue answered: The Chinese side has taken note of the recent adoption of the report by the European Parliament.
The report says that there is a wide range of common interests between China and the EU, advocating the development of the China-EU partnership, strengthening bilateral contacts, exchanges and dialogue, and expanding bilateral cooperation in economic, trade, scientific, technological, educational, and cultural fields.
We welcome these positive ideas.
However, the report has made many erroneous conclusions on the human rights situation in China, as well as Taiwan and Tibet, and has seriously interfered in China's internal affairs. This is unacceptable to the Chinese side.
It is hoped that the European Parliament will strictly abide by the one-China principle and do more things beneficial to the development of bilateral relations, so as not to have a negative impact on the relations between China and the EU.
Release of the kidnapped Indian Office of the High Commissioner in Pakistan

At Qana, he was beaten and injured and is now in hospital.
She said that the Palestinian police refused to use the incident as a case of kidnapping. This makes people suspect that the Pakistani intelligence department was involved in this incident.
Qana was kidnapped when he was working at a bus on the morning of 19 July.
On the morning of the same day, the Indian Foreign Ministry issued a statement strongly protesting against Pakistan's kidnapping of the Indian Office of the High Commissioner in Pakistan in broad daylight.

Israel says it will cooperate with the United Nations fact-finding team
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) Israeli government officials said on Thursday that they would cooperate with the United Nations in carrying out a fact-finding mission to the Palestinian refugee camp in the west bank of the Jordan River.
Israel Radio quoted a government official as saying that Israel would present to the United Nations mission a videotape of the military operations carried out by the Israeli army in the Jenin refugee camp and allow members of the delegation to interview soldiers and commanders involved in military operations, and hoped that the delegation would remain objective and impartial in the course of the investigation.
On the 19th, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution proposed by the United States to welcome the investigation of the Jenin refugee camp by the UN investigation team.
Just a few hours before the voting, Foreign Minister Peres made a phone call to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, saying that Israel would welcome the United Nations representative to "clarify" the truth of the Jenin refugee camp.
Annan also expressed his agreement with the United Nations delegation to carry out an investigation on the same day.
According to sources, Ben elazawa and Peres claimed that the Israeli army had engaged in a fierce exchange of fire with Palestinian militants while carrying out military operations in the Jenin refugee camp. Twenty-three Israeli soldiers were killed, and 50 people were killed, most of them Palestinian militants.

The Palestinian side accused the Israeli army of killing Palestinians there, killing hundreds of people, but Israel denied it.
China expresses strong dissatisfaction with Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here today that China is firmly opposed to the Japanese leaders paying homage at the Yasukuni Shrine, which houses the memorial tablets of Class-A war criminals in any form and at any time.
The Chinese side expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Japanese leader's action.
Zhang Qiyue said in a speech on Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine this morning that Japan's approach will only damage Japan's own image and make it more difficult for Japan to win the trust of the peoples of Asian countries on historical issues.
This is the second time that Koizumi has visited Yasukuni Shrine since he took office.
The Yasukuni Shrine is a place where Japanese pay their respects to war (mostly wars of aggression) since the Meiji Restoration. Class-A war criminals such as Hideki Tojo and other Class-A war criminals in World War II were also held here.
First round of voting in French presidential election
PARIS, April 21 (Xinhua) The first round of the French presidential election started here today.
A total of 40 million voters in the country will elect the seventh President of the French Republic of France among the 16 candidates.
The result of the poll will be announced on the evening of the day.
According to a communique issued by the French Ministry of the Interior, as of 12: 00 noon on the 21st, the voter turnout rate was 21.41 percent, down from 22.52 percent in the first round of voting in the presidential election in 1995.
According to local media forecasts, the voter turnout rate this year may set a historical record.
The French Constitution stipulates that if no candidate obtains more than 51 per cent of the votes in the first ballot, the two candidates with the highest number of votes will enter the second round of competition on 5 May.
The results of the final public opinion poll released last Friday showed that current President Chirac and current Prime Minister Lionel Jospin may win in the first round with very close votes.
As the number of candidates in this presidential election is as high as 16, setting a record high in French history, voters may be very dispersed in the first round of voting.
In the first round, the presidential candidate of the French far right National Front, Lepang, may be in third place, and may even be exposed to the "surprises" of the first two.

He pointed out that the strengthening of cooperation between Georgia and the United States in the military field is not aimed at Russia.
According to reports, according to an agreement reached between the two countries, US military experts will help Georgia train four battalions and one company.
Correspondents stationed in foreign countries urged the Israeli army to return confiscated press cards
JERUSALEM, April 22 (Xinhua) The Israeli Foreign Journalists Association today issued a statement calling on the Israeli military to return the press cards of at least 17 foreign journalists in the West Bank city of Bethlehem.
The statement said that on the same day, an Israeli military officer confiscated the documents of a number of Palestinians and foreign journalists working for the international news agencies about 400 meters away from the great Church of Jesus, on the ground that it was a military restricted area, but no documents were produced.
The statement pointed out that the Israeli army's confiscation of press cards was in fact an attempt to restrict media coverage of the confrontation between the Israeli army and Palestinian militants in the great Church of the birth of Jesus, and not out of consideration for the safety of journalists. This was in violation of the Israeli army's commitment to foreign associations last week.
On 2 April, the Israeli army in Bethlehem occupied more than 200 Palestinian militants in the Cathedral of Jesus. The confrontation between the two sides continued to this day.

North Korean patrol boat charged into South Korea's territorial waters
A Korean official said that a Korean patrol boat broke into South Korea's territorial waters yesterday.
The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the patrol boat crossed 1.5 km from the Yellow Sea border and stayed for 42 minutes before being driven away by the South Korean warship.
It stated that the Korean patrol boat had accidentally entered the territorial waters of South Korea while inspecting a Cambodian cargo ship.
The maritime boundary between Korea and the DPRK is not clear, and yesterday's violation was the second of its kind in this year.
South Korea accused North Korea of violating the western waters 12 times last year, but each time it was not serious.
In 1999, a series of violations by the Korean vessels caused the first maritime clash since the Korean War, resulting in the sinking of a Korean warship. It was believed that 30 Korean sailors were killed.
On the other hand, according to intelligence sources, 25 Koreans were staying at an army base in the Philippines yesterday before flying to South Korea for asylum.
The refugees arrived at the Manila airport from Beijing on Friday evening.
"The documents they went to Korea are being processed," the spokesman said.
The South Korean Foreign Ministry said that this group of Koreans will fly to Seoul on Monday by South Korean Airlines passenger plane.
US official: Al Qaeda to strengthen capital flow
(Washington, D.C.) according to US media reports, an official of the United States, who is unwilling to disclose his name, said in the past few weeks that al Qaeda, the world's number one terrorist organization, has increased its activities in the financial field. This shows that some leaders of al Qaeda are resuming control over the organization and may seek to finance more attacks against US targets.
The official said that while there had been an increase in the flow of funds to al-Qa'idah, communication links between the surviving al Qaeda members were also on the increase.
Information intercepted by the intelligence services of the United States indicates that members of the small al Qaeda group and the Taliban are in the process of being contacted.
Most of the communications activities are concentrated in the north-western part of Pakistan, close to the Afghan border.
According to the official, these activities show that some well-known al-Qaida leaders are resuming control over the remnants of this terrorist organization, but the United States official does not wish to list the names of these people.
Kannistro, former head of the anti-terrorism department of the US Central Intelligence Agency, said that there are numerous signs that Al Qaeda is being reorganized and that the large volume of communications between them is carried out via the Internet, and there are frequent financial exchanges.
Kandahar also said that some evidence suggests that the leadership of the Al Qaeda organization has also begun to be active.
Chen Jinde, legislative councilor of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party, and fishery groups to visit Beijing
Chen Jinde, legislative councilor of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party, arrived in Beijing yesterday for a visit to Beijing.
Chen Jinde was the first member of the Democratic Progressive Party to visit the mainland following a speech by Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen in commemoration of the seventh anniversary of Jiang Zemin's visit to mainland China.
Chen Jinde arrived in Hong Kong on Saturday to obtain a visa, and arrived in Beijing yesterday for 10 days.
Chen Jinde stressed that the purpose of his trip was purely to help him solve the problem of shortage of fishermen in the Ilan constituency. He went to the mainland in his personal capacity. However, he disclosed that he would meet with officials of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and relevant mainland organizations. He hoped that the Beijing authorities would agree to resume the opening up of the fishing industry.
In the wake of the ban on fishing industry in mainland China, there is a serious shortage of fish in the Ilan area.
The delegation, headed by the director general of the Taiwan fishing association, was led by the director general of the Taiwan fishing association.
Another serious sandstorm in Beijing
China's state media said that there was another serious sandstorm yesterday in Beijing.
Although the government has invested heavily in improving the environment in Beijing to prevent the desert from approaching Beijing, it is still the major difficulty faced by Beijing, which plans to hold the Olympic Games in 2008.
The National Weather Bureau of China predicted that this year's first sandstorm hit Beijing last Friday. The summit of cold air from Mongolia is expected to cause Beijing to be covered with grey and yellow dust.
Yang Weixi, chief engineer of the desert control center of the Chinese Forestry Department, told the "Beijing weekly": "I dare not say that there will not be a sandstorm in 2008.
What we can do is to control the human factor that produces sandstorms and to prevent desertification in the environment. "
He said, however, the natural factors, such as the wind, the drought and the great desert, which go beyond people's control, make it impossible for China to avoid sandstorms in the short term.
The Chinese government has pledged to invest $56.8 billion (approximately $123.76 million) from 2002 to 2008 to prevent desertification and reduce the production of sandstorms.
Beijing alone will cost about 1 billion yuan (approximately NT $220 million) this year.
An expert from the Chinese Academy of Forestry said: "The increase in funding will greatly improve the situation. However, it may take several decades before we can see the effects of governance."
After conducting an investigation at the beginning of this year, Chinese environmental experts warned that about one third of China's territory is now desert, which is mainly caused by human economic activities, such as overgrazing.
The survey reported that in the first six months of last year, there were 18 sandstorms in Beijing, which all came from Inner Mongolia, and 60 percent of the land in Inner Mongolia was desert.
At the closing session of the National People's Congress this month, people's congress deputies from Shanghai, Beijing and Inner Mongolia urged the government to "set up a green Great Wall, made up of forests," to block the attack of the sandstorm.
According to a report by the Shanghai Star, Xu Shiyuan, vice president of the China Geographical Society, warned that if the government does not take urgent measures, the sandstorm may even attack Shanghai.
Many in-service cadres found to be infected with fake certificates in Chinese fake certificates
The fake diploma in Hong Kong is rampant in mainland China. The guidance center for employment of university graduates in Guangdong Province recently identified a certificate of academic qualifications for 15 officials from a city in the Chaoshan region. Seven of the certificates were confirmed by the naked eye.
According to press reports in Hong Kong, the centre has been certified for work since May last year. So far, more than 3,500 certificates have been certified and more than 800 certificates of all kinds have been certified. The number of false certificates is as high as 23 percent.
According to reports, most of these fake certificates are for adult education and self-study examinations, two thirds of which are forged by the street and one third by regular educational institutions.
The head of the center also disclosed that because of the institutional reforms at the time of the establishment of the Identification Department, most of those submitted for censorship were organs and enterprises, and some of them had a very high proportion of fake certificates, and many of them were serving cadres.
With the approval of the relevant department of the Ministry of National Education, the Center for job placement of university graduates in Guangdong Province is the only institution in China that is authorized to carry out a nationwide certificate of academic qualifications for higher education.
The person in charge also disclosed that out of consideration for the selection of officials, a state-owned bank in a local level city sent out a diploma of 36 middle-ranking officials and key business leaders, but only six of them were genuine.
It is understood that with the identification process, quite a number of private enterprises have also asked for evaluation, and the main items they identified are the candidates and the newly introduced university students.
The Identification Department found that many of the certificates issued by university students were fake.
Last year, a large company set up a branch in a certain area of the Pearl River Delta, recruiting a group of university students.
The boss brought to an appraisal the academic qualifications of more than 30 staff members, and found that 10 were false.
In recent years, a number of tertiary institutions have set up teaching points in Guangdong Province. They have not issued any certificate of academic qualifications. However, in order to attract trainees, they have made a fraud at the time of admission, claiming that they can issue a certificate of recognition to the students and produce a batch of false certificates to students when they graduate.
25 asylum seekers arrive in Seoul
(Seoul, Seoul) 25 Koreans seeking asylum arrived at Seoul International Airport yesterday to start a new life in South Korea.
After passing the border, they waved to the Korean television camera with a smile.
At a temporary press conference held at the airport, the 43 year-old factory worker, Lee Sung, said: "We want to settle here and live in a world where freedom is full of hope."
Another man said, "because Korea is a free country, I will not hesitate to die."
This group of Koreans stormed into the Spanish Embassy in Beijing on Thursday and firmly declared that they would go to South Korea.
On Friday, China allowed them to go to Seoul via the Philippines.
They came from six families, two of whom had no parents.
They are the largest group of people who have fled since the end of the Korean War.
According to the Seoul National Intelligence Agency, the group will join the 2,000 Korean people who have settled in Korea. Of these, 138 will be in the Republic of Korea only this year.
Last year, 583 people joined the Republic of Korea, breaking the record.
The 25 new arrivals will adapt to a government shelter near the capital city of Seoul.
The primary objective of the course is to help those who change themselves to overcome the tension in flight and then receive counselling to adapt to Korean culture, including knowledge of capitalism.
The final step would be to receive new job training.
New Yorker weekly: Iraqi intelligence agency has been in close contact with al Qaeda for many years
(Washington, D.C.) the latest issue of the New Yorker weekly reported that the intelligence agencies in Iraq have maintained close contacts over the years with Al Qaeda, the leader of the September 11 attacks.
It was reported that the two organizations jointly directed a terrorist organization in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq.
The Central Intelligence Agency of the United States has always been skeptical about the allegations made by Iraqi President Hu Hin and Al Qaeda.
The "Hawk" officials who supported the military action against Iraq in the Bush administration have been trying in the past to find evidence of the links between huhin and Al Qaeda.
These officials spoke highly of the report of the "New Yorker" on the day before yesterday and said that the report was the latest basis for supporting their arguments.
It was reported that in the Kurdish area of Iraq there was an ANSA Muslim guerrilla group made up of Kurds and Arabs. Members of the guerrilla group had been trained in the Obama camp.
This report, the author of the report, said that he had interviewed a number of agents of the al-Faisal Islamic guerrillas who had been captured by the pro-American Kurdish organization "Kurdish Patriotic Alliance". These agents claimed that the ANSA Muslim guerrillas were under the joint command of huhin and Al Qaeda, and that some of the al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan had fled to the Iraqi Kurdish areas under the control of the Muslim guerrillas.
The agents also stated that Iraq had hosted a al Qaeda leader from Egypt in Baghdad in 1992.
US officials warned that the Kurdish Patriotic Alliance may make a big contribution to the relevant reports in order to prove that the plan of the United States to overthrow the Saddam regime is justified.
Gulf state newspaper: Cheney's Middle East trip fails
The Gulf state newspaper reported on Monday that US Vice President Cheney's current trip to the Middle East was a failure.
Cheney's visit is to persuade Middle East countries to support the US attack on Iraq.
During his visit to all the Gulf countries, Cheney went to Kuwait on Monday, but even the most loyal US ally opposed the attack on Baghdad.
Saudi Arabia's "homeland of the motherland" said, "the vice president heard that the United States must stop Israel's terrorist actions and prevent Israel from possessing weapons of mass destruction."
The paper also pointed out that "if the United States continues to ignore the interests of the Middle East countries, it will also lose its interests in the Gulf region."
The United Arab Emirates "Gulf Daily" also said, "This is the new failure of the United States in the Middle East after the defeat of Europe.
Most of the European allies in the United States have openly opposed the attack on Iraq. "
Cheney, in the capital of Bahrain yesterday, denied that his Middle East trip was aimed at organizing military strikes against Iraq.
At a joint press conference with the Crown Prince of Bahrain, he said that some people believed that the only interest in his visit was to organize military strikes against Iraq, but he denied this.
Cheney said that he and Crown Prince Salman mainly discussed the war on terrorism, the latest developments in the Middle East situation, and the situation in Afghanistan.
Cheney arrived in Israel on Monday evening. He is expected to meet with Prime Minister Sabon to discuss the latest developments in the Israeli-Palestinian situation.
On the other hand, the regional commander of the Israeli and Palestinian sides in the West Bank and the region of the West Bank yesterday unexpectedly held talks aimed at putting an end to the violence in the region.
This meeting could be the first step taken by Israel to withdraw its troops from ICA.
The Palestinian side said that if the Israeli army does not withdraw from these areas, the Palestinian side will not participate in the peace talks mediated by the United States.
Increasing number of street crime cases in the United Kingdom
The British government is committed to solving the growing problem of street crime and will deploy more police patrols.
Interior Minister Blunkett said that in order to contain the rising number of street robberies and violent cases, it is very necessary to increase police patrols.
He said: "It is true that we should rectify the order in the streets, because law-abiding citizens want to walk safely in the streets and live a safe life without fear of being attacked."
While the overall crime rate in the United Kingdom declined, the number of street crimes increased by 13 per cent between 2000 and 2001.
The situation in London was even more alarming. The number of robberies reported in September and November 2001 alone was 12,248, more than double that of 8614 in the same period of the previous year.
The government also said that the increase in crime was mainly due to a large increase in looting of cell phones. Last year, more than 700,000 cell phone robberies occurred nationwide.
This is the first time that the British police have focused their attention on street thugs and looting, and in the past concentrated on cracking down on illegal possession of firearms and the sale of drugs on the streets.
The new scheme will first be implemented in the more concentrated neighbourhoods of 10 street crime cases.
The police will step up patrols in these neighbourhoods and provide more protection to the victims.
Group demonstrations by 10 state factory workers in Liaoning
The workers of 10 state factories in Liaoning Province, northeast China's Liaoning Province, held a collective demonstration yesterday to protest against the arrears of wages and pensions, the low rate of reduction, and corruption.
At the same time, demonstrations for the dismissal of oil workers in Daqing City, Heilongjiang Province, have lasted for three weeks.
The information center for human rights in China, which is based in Hong Kong, said that the public security bureau of Liaoning Province arrested an organizer of the demonstration, 54 year-old Yao Fuxin, while looking for more than 10 other workers in the demonstration.
According to a relative of Yao who refused to reveal his name, he said: "When he went out to buy things, he did not come back. Several people saw him taken away."
In addition, in the Daqing Oilfield in nearby provinces, the police and the Daqing Oil Administration told the reporter that the sit-in demonstration of the dismissed oil workers has entered its third week. However, the number of workers participating in the sit-in has decreased from 50,000 to more than 1,000.
According to sources, workers in these two cities have established independent trade unions and have decided to negotiate through election representatives.
Such action is not permissible under the law.
Han Dongfang, host of the China labour organization in Hong Kong, said that although both demonstrations started at the end of the National People's Congress, the problem has been in existence for a long time.
South Korea also said that a demonstration was also held on Monday in a textile factory in Guangyuan City, Sichuan, where a few workers' leaders were arrested on the weekend. As a result, 1,000 workers staged a demonstration in protest.
The new aviation difficult investigation report: The Taiwan Security Council has repeatedly delayed the prosecution's doubt that there is mysteries inside the investigation.
It has been one and a half years since the new air traffic accident occurred. The investigation report of the Taiwan Aviation Safety Commission has been postponed again and again, leading to a stagnation in the investigation of the Taoyuan district prosecutor's office, and the prosecutor's challenge is that the investigation report will be delivered in April.
On the evening of 31 October 2000, at 11: 18 p.m., a Singapore Airlines flight from Chung Cheng Airport to Los Angeles, in Los Angeles, took off for an explosion, causing the explosion of two dredgers on the runway. As a result, 83 passengers died and nearly one hundred passengers were injured.
The "China Times" reported yesterday that the Taoyuan local prosecutor's office, which was responsible for investigating criminal charges after the air crash, had a number of disputes over the flying unit of the aviation accident investigation.
Since the beginning of the air crash, the chief prosecutor of the Taoyuan local prosecutor's office, Wang Yu-sheng, has been promoted to the public prosecutor's office in Taichung.
The mission said that the investigation report could be completed at the end of last year, then until the end of January, after which it was completed in February. It has still not been followed by the prosecutor, who promised to deliver in April.
Some of the victims' families have brought a large amount of civil compensation to the US courts, including the Singapore Airlines, as well as the Taiwan civil aviation authority.
The claim of the family members of the victims is tantamount to accusing the Taiwan tower of having a lack of responsibility. As a result, the investigation findings of the Taoyuan district prosecutor's office have attracted special attention.
Allawi wants to hold bilateral talks if it complies with US ceasefire agreement
(Jerusalem) Israeli Prime Minister Sabon said yesterday that if the Palestinian leader arlaw followed up on the ceasefire agreement proposed by the United States, Israel would allow it to leave the Palestinian territory.
US Vice President Cheney also said yesterday that he would be prepared to hold talks with the other side on the Middle East peace process in the near future if it implements the truce agreement proposed by the United States.
The Arab League Secretary General Moussa said yesterday that the Arab League will support a land exchange peace plan at a summit to be held next week to prevent the escalation of violent clashes in the Middle East.
In an interview with the Italian newspaper The late post, Moussa said: "I believe there will be a clear and consistent position on the Arab summit to be held in Beirut, that is, the exchange of land for peace.
At that time, Israel must make a decision. "
Egyptian Foreign Minister Maher said on the day before yesterday that even if Israel does not allow Allawi to attend the Arab League summit, Saudi Arabia will still propose a peace proposal to resolve the violent conflict in the Middle East at the summit.
Annan condemns military actions ignoring safety of civilian life
On the other hand, UN Secretary General Annan sent a letter to Sabon the day before yesterday, condemning Israel's failure to take into account the safety of civilians in the gradual escalation of its military operations, and that the conflict "has evolved into a conventional war with no restraint."
Annan said that Israel has dispatched F-16 fighters, helicopters, naval armed aircraft and missiles to carry out intensive bombing, "resulting in the wounding or killing of thousands of innocent civilians, including women and children, and the destruction or destruction of many buildings and houses."
Annan called on Sharon to ensure that Israel's security forces "use weapons and methods of warfare that pose the lowest threat to the safety and property of the Palestinian civilians."
Global warming to mark the complete collapse of the Antarctic ice frame
An expert from the US National Snow Data Center said yesterday that an ice block in the Antarctic has completely broken down and split into thousands of iceberg. This is the largest of such incidents in 30 years, and this has once again sounded the alarm for global warming.
It has been alleged that, over a period of 35 days, a total of 3,250 square kilometres of the ice shelf in the vicinity of the eastern coast of Antarctica has been completely dismantled.
The center warned that with the advent of the hot summer, other ice frames were on the verge of collapse.
This is an indication that the flow of ice in Antarctica will increase and the global sea level will rise to the detriment of lowland areas.
The center, located at the University of Colorado, on its Web site (nsidc.org), said that it might have already started to split on January 31 this year with a total of 7 20 billion tons of ice, and the ice has formed thousands of floating iceberg.
The centre also indicated that the reason for the division of the ice was the regional warming of the region.
More than half of the British did not agree to the government's support of the US fight against Iraq.
The results of a public opinion poll released yesterday showed that more than half of the British voters did not support the government's support for the US attack on Iraq.
The results of a public opinion poll conducted by the Guardian and the public opinion polls showed that 51% of voters opposed Britain's support for the US attack on Iraq.
In contrast to similar polls conducted last year and three years ago, most British voters supported the attack on Iraq.
A similar opinion poll released by the US cable news network and Time magazine the day before yesterday showed that 70% of Americans support the government's attack on Iraq's overthrow of the Saddam regime.
In Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said the day before yesterday that if the United States leads the coalition forces to attack Iraq, Canada will consider joining.
Jean Chretien and other Canadian ministers have always expressed concern over Bush's taking a tough stand against the Iraqi regime in Iraq, and has consistently maintained that there is no evidence to show that huhin and al Qaeda are connected.
However, after he arrived in Washington for talks with Bush last Thursday, he seems to have changed his original position.
He said that he would seriously consider any request from the United States for military assistance outside Afghanistan.
He said: "with regard to the participation of the force, if there are situations in other places like Afghanistan, we will look at the situation at that time, as we did in Afghanistan."
The United States will reduce the number of fighter planes patrolling in the country's airspace.
US Defense Department officials said on Monday that the Bush administration has decided to lower the level of patrol of the air force fighters that started after the September 11 attacks, but it will still maintain a smaller number of patrols and allow aircraft to await orders on the runway.
According to the Ministry of Defense, the Air Force has cost US $500 million (about NZ $900 million), but its patrols over Washington will continue. As for the New York area, air patrols will cease in addition to the emergency in the New York area.
The airport and airlines have tightened security measures in the wake of the September 11 incident before the authorities decided to reduce or stop air patrols.
Defense Ministry spokesman Clark told the reporter, "We are studying a plan that combines different approaches, including patrols of fighter planes over specific areas and interim decisions, as well as various levels of runway standby measures," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
The runway standby means that the plane is in a state of readiness and is ready to take off at any time.
She also said that security would be adjusted at any time according to the level of threat.
Seven people killed and 30 injured in bus explosion
(Jerusalem composite) police said that a suicide bomber detonated a bus yesterday in the Arab town of Umm Qasr, near the northern part of Israel, killing seven people and injuring some 30 people.
Most of the buses at the time were Israeli Arabs.
The Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack.
The Palestinian Authority has condemned the violence.
This is the most serious attack since the US special envoy to the Middle East arrived in the Middle East on Thursday to urge Israel and Palestine to reach a ceasefire agreement.
A spokesman for the bus company said: "A suicide bomber blew himself up in the rear of the bus.
The car was full at the time, and it was heading from Tel Aviv to the northern Israeli city of nazarres. "
The spokesman also said that most of the passengers were Israeli Arabs who had to go to work.
The explosion occurred near the "green line" area, close to the separation of Israel and the West Bank.
The attack brought the death toll of the Palestinians to 1,562 since the beginning of the intifada in September of the previous year.
US Senator: terrorists who are infected with smallpox can spread the virus at the airport
(Washington, USA) a US senator, doctors of the United States, warned at a hearing on biological and chemical weapons the day before yesterday that terrorists infected with smallpox could spread the virus throughout the country through the transmission of deadly viruses or bacteria at the airport, which could lead to the death of tens of thousands or even millions of people.
At the hearing, the friary said that terrorists who are infected with smallpox walk into an airport. Through coughing, sneezing, or even breathing, the virus may pass the virus to ten innocent passengers, and it may lead to the spread of the virus throughout the country and may lead to the death of tens of thousands or even millions of people.
This may be the possible form of weapons of mass destruction, he said.
It does not need to be launched through missiles, nor does it need to be as attractive as anthrax.
The victims of the disease and the defence personnel who have prevented such weapons from being attacked may never be aware of the origin of the virus (bacteria).
The experts told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: This is part of the reason why biological and chemical weapons are so dangerous.
Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the prevention of biological and chemical weapons is an extremely urgent problem that must be addressed.
The United States still needs to set up a missile defense system in order to prevent enemy missiles from carrying any kind of warheads to attack the United States.
Hundreds of thousands of US and South Korean soldiers carry out large-scale exercises
(Seoul, France) hundreds of thousands of American and Korean soldiers will start military exercises of the largest scale on Thursday to simulate the conflict between the DPRK and the DPRK. This has caused Pyongyang to attack as a provocative act of war.
On the eve of a week's military exercise, US military officers said that the exercise was purely defensive in nature. However, it happened after the Seoul authorities warned that the Korean issue could not be ignored.
This is the largest military exercise since the Korean war of 1950-53. Since it has not concluded a formal treaty to put an end to the Korean peninsula conflict, it has become the world's last line of the Cold War, with nearly 2 million troops on the border.
The headquarters of the US-British coalition forces in Seoul said that the exercise to be held from 21 to 27 March will be the first time that two different joint military exercises will be used to test their effects.
This means that hundreds of thousands of soldiers will participate, but the military has not disclosed the details.
A spokesman for the coalition forces said that the exercise will mobilize almost every US and Korean military units and foreign troops on the Korean Peninsula.
Three thousand seven thousand US troops are stationed in South Korea, preventing the North Korea, which has an army of 1.1 million troops, to launch an attack.
There are also 650,000 troops in the Republic of Korea.
The headquarters of the coalition forces claimed that this exercise is rs0i / fe02, which is a combination of computerized military exercises and the annual "infant Eagle" exercise.
In the past few years, the RSOI exercise alone mobilized half a million Korean troops and 30,000 US troops (including 20,000 foreign troops).
The DPRK accused the United States of holding a joint military exercise in order to provoke a war.
The official "Labor News" even claimed that the US-ROK military exercise was a "declaration of war."
The Chinese media praised the strategic missile force
China's official media yesterday praised its strategic missile force in the argument that the US "nuclear power assessment" has listed China as the target of nuclear attack.
The PLA Daily, the People's Daily, and other official daily newspapers published the "forged Republic Peace Shield" on their front pages and highly praised China's second artillery corps, including strategic missiles and nuclear weapons troops.
This article describes the force's use of the "strategic missile training simulation system" to simulated a nuclear attack by an enemy state and a counter-attack by the "red army" or China.
The "red army" used modern procedures to quickly formulate a combat plan and deploy a new missile launch vehicle in the mountains of the mountains.
This article, which is full of technical words, describes the use of innovative anti-interference and anti-reconnaissance technology by the Second Artillery Corps.
The article went on to say that a missile, "from the deep mountains of the mountains, accurately hit the target," successfully carried out a counter-attack.
The Second Artillery Corps, with an estimated 100,000 petty officers, is the core of China's efforts to improve the combat technology of the armed forces.
The article describing the process of the growth of China's missiles and nuclear forces since the late 1950s has been published at a time when Sino-US relations are again tense.
In order to prevent the Koreans from "making a career" again, China has stepped up security at the embassy area.
The Chinese police recently launched an internal review of the incident in which 25 Korean people broke into the Spanish embassy last week.
It is estimated that in Beijing alone, more than 150 Koreans have to go to Korea, and the authorities have stepped up security at the main embassies of South Korea, Japan and the Western countries to prevent the recurrence of the incident.
The Sing Tao Daily reported yesterday that according to news from the public security department, following the sudden attack of 25 Koreans in the western class on 14 March, the Beijing police further deployed security to the embassies of sensitive countries after "September 11". At the same time, they have also stepped up liaison with the officials of the North Korean and South Korean embassies.
According to sources, the Korean embassy officials told Chinese officials that the South Korean side did not support the Koreans to go to South Korea. South Korea did not want such incidents to happen again, so as not to affect the relations between China and the Korean Peninsula.
According to reports, there are about 10,000 Korean people living in the eastern district of Beijing and the Chaoyang district of Chaoyang District. Among them are Korean people from the north and south of China. There are also people from North Korea and South Korea who are mainly engaged in such business as Korean restaurants and bars.
In the past, because of the small number of Korean people in Beijing and the fact that there were many criminal cases involving Xinjiang people and Henan people, the authorities did not take them as the focus of surveillance.
The report said that after the incident on 14 March, the public security department will first assist the 25 Koreans' German doctors to "talk" to the public security department and then send him to the airport to ask him to leave the country immediately.
Subsequently, the public security and security departments conducted an internal review.
The review is mainly based on two aspects. One is the security of the ambassadors, and the other is the management of the Korean people in Beijing.
In addition, the authorities have also asked relevant departments in Jilin and other regions to take effective measures to prevent illegal entry of North Korean people into Beijing.
Yellow sand on the Korean Peninsula
(Pyongyang, Seoul) after a fierce attack on the Korean peninsula yesterday, most parts of the Korean Peninsula, including Pyongyang, the capital of Korea, and Seoul, the capital of the Republic of Korea, were covered with brown and yellow dust.
According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency, a strong sandstorm hit Pyongyang early yesterday morning.
From the early morning, the whole of Pyongyang was enveloped by a grey area of dust.
This is the first sandstorm that the DPRK has experienced since spring this year.
Six routes grounded
In addition, according to a report by the Beijing People's Daily Online, a large area of "Sandstorm" appeared in South Korea yesterday. In addition to the Incheon International Airport, six routes inside the country were grounded.
There is a "Sandstorm" across the country.
According to tests conducted by the Ministry of the environment of the Republic of Korea, the small amount of dust in the skies of Seoul yesterday was 17 times greater than the usual level, reaching 1,000 grams per cubic metre. This is the highest record in history.
Under the influence of the National dust weather, in addition to the normal operation of the Incheon International Airport, South Korea has been grounded in six routes including Tai Qiu, Wai Shan, and Posco. More than 30 passengers from more than 30 flights have switched to other means of transportation.
In addition, according to an Associated Press report, due to the excessive amount of dust in the air, the South Korean government yesterday ordered that kindergartens and primary schools in the country be suspended for one day in order to prevent children from being polluted.
Since the beginning of this year, there have been three yellow dust storms in Seoul, South Korea.
The South Korea Meteorological agency forecast yesterday that the large amount of dust resulting from a strong surge in desert areas such as China and Mongolia spread over the northern part of China and via the northwest wind to South Korea.
This is enough to destroy the medium-sized urban small planet from the face of the earth.
In Melbourne, Florida, a small planet that was large enough to destroy a medium-sized city, flying over the Earth at a close distance of 463,000 km, was not discovered earlier, and astronomers only learned about it four days later.
This small planet, with a diameter of about 50 metres, comes from the direction of the sun, so it is difficult for astronomers to find it.
The planet flew over the Earth on 8 March, but by the time it was discovered on 12 March, the planet had gone away.
Williams, located at the center of the International Astronomical Society, Cambridge, Massachusetts, has helped to determine the location of this small planet.
From the point of view of astronomy, the planet is very close to the earth, because the moon is 402,000 km from the earth.
On Wednesday, Williams said to Florida's "Today's Daily," "The key is that the stars should be detected before the sun is issued."
In this way, astronomers will be able to determine the orbit of a small planet as soon as possible and predict whether it will hit the Earth.
In 1908, when a star, big or small, crashed into the earth, it struck a 32 km wide pit in the forest of Siberia.
The minister of the Interior confirmed that the senior government advisor had been shot dead by "a Brigade".
(Rome, new electricity) Italian Minister of the Interior scjala confirmed the day before yesterday that the senior advisor to the Italian government, Biji, was shot dead by a branch of the extreme left-wing guerrillas.
Skjala said that the two men who were shot to death were even using a pistol similar to a political assassination that was used three years ago.
On the other hand, Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi has taken the initiative to invite trade union leaders to return to the negotiating table after his assassination in Biji, to discuss the employment reform plan he has proposed.
The 52 year old adviser to the Ministry of Labour, Biji, is also an economist and a professor of law.
He was shot and killed by gunmen who were riding on a bicycle on Tuesday night when he was riding a bicycle to live in the northern city of boloia. It shocked the Italian political arena.
It has assisted in the drafting of an employment reform programme, which has been strongly opposed by trade unions and left-wing elements.
They were of the view that the programme would make it easier for employers to dismiss workers.
Witnesses said that he was lying in a pool of blood in a pool of blood and his briefcase was on the side.
The home of Biji was also found to be marked with the five-star logo of the brigade, but it is not clear at this point when it was put up.
The brigade was established in 1973 and was involved in numerous bombings and assassinations in Italy in the 1970s and 1980s, including the kidnapping and killing of former Prime Minister Moo in 1978.
Five years in prison for illegal acquisition of Chinese state secrets and bribery of American Chinese engineers
The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court ruled yesterday that an American Chinese engineer was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on charges of illegal acquisition of state secrets and bribery of a company.
The case has aroused a protest from the United States.
A spokesman for the US Embassy in China said that the party will be deported after the expiry of his sentence.
The term of imprisonment will be adjusted in accordance with the time he has been imprisoned.
The United States embassy sent a diplomat to hear the case.
His lawyer said that his client had been in jail for two years, but China said that it had not been for such a long time.
The Xinhua News Agency confirmed the verdict.
It said that from 1995 to 1999, there were 35 documents containing state secrets and bribery of Chinese civil servants with US $245,000 (now about $450,000) to assist foreign investors in bidding for China's electricity projects.
This is the power engineering consultant for foreign companies in China and elsewhere in Asia.
William Cohen, a representative of the reinstated Party, said that the Party has repeatedly denied bribery and said that he is a victim of a corrupt Chinese power official.
He said that he was a Chinese power official in the past and became a US citizen in 1994.
In the past two years, a group of American citizens and residents have been accused of violating China's national security law.
China and the United States have been detained for a period of time, which has caused tension in Sino-US relations.
The US government has repeatedly protested against the handling of the case by the Chinese authorities, pointing out that the authorities' detention for a few months without trial runs counter to international norms.
His family said that he had been subjected to harsh treatment.
His wife and two children were United States citizens.
Cohen said that he was detained on 28 February 2000, but the detention period proposed by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was 28 August 2000.
China does not want to confirm whether Hu Jintao will visit the United States according to the original plan.
The relations between China and the United States were rapidly cooling down as a result of US President Bush's visit to China. China yesterday confirmed the cancellation of this year's plan to visit the US ports, and refused to confirm whether Vice President Hu Jintao would visit the United States as scheduled.
In response to a question raised by a routine reporter, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said: "As far as I know, the Chinese naval fleet is preparing to visit the country as planned, and their plans do not include the ports of the United States."
When a reporter asked her twice whether the plan for Hu Jintao's visit to the United States had been affected, he asked for clarification as to whether the earlier reply could be understood as the scheduled time for Hu Jintao's visit to the United States in April.
Zhang Qiyue only repeatedly accused the US side of "taking a series of violations of the three joint communiques between China and the United States" in the short period of one month after Bush's visit to China, and asked the US side to "stop using the Taiwan issue to interfere in China's internal affairs."
On the other hand, in Washington, in response to China's warning that Sino-US relations are blowing a cold wind, the United States did not pay attention on Wednesday and insisted that the United States would allow Taiwan's defense minister to take part in the "US-Taiwan defense summit" in Florida.
Beijing has repeatedly criticized the United States for issuing a visa to Taiwan's defense minister Tang Yao-ming to attend a meeting hosted by US arms dealers earlier this month.
Tang Yao-ming also met with two senior U.S. officials at the time.
State Department spokesman Boucher was asked by reporters at a press conference to question China's complaints about the incident. However, he made great efforts to avoid fighting with China.
He said: "After the talks, our position is well known.
You have to ask me every day. I am willing to explain every day that China has to ask this question every day, and we are willing to explain it every day. "
"Our position has not changed. These are normal contacts between US and the people of Taiwan, and we will continue to do so," he said.
Zhang Qiyue also confirmed yesterday that the Russian media reported that Chinese President Jiang Zemin had talked with him at the request of Russian President Putin. The two sides exchanged views on the issue of mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Russia.
Both sides agreed that mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Russia conforms to the interests of the two countries and the two peoples.
