During the emergency period, Palestinian Prime Minister fararde will form a new government. "
A month of emergency was imposed by the Palestinian Authority after the takeover of the Gaza Strip by the Hamas militants, and Prime Minister fararde temporarily resigned, but was entrusted with the task of forming a new government. "
The minister of agriculture and social affairs, Habali, told Agence France-Presse: "Prime Minister fararde submitted his resignation to President Abbas. The president accepted it, and at the same time asked him to form a new cabinet with responsibility for the day-to-day administration of the cabinet."
Abbas, a close friend of Abbas, told AFP that Abbas had submitted his resignation, while Abbas ordered him to "carry out his current duties until he forms a new government."
A highly respected economist, fararde, has tendered his resignation, but his resignation is only a procedural resignation, and he will not waver in his position as prime minister.
France has been leading the Palestinian emergency cabinet since the 17th of last month and is responsible for the implementation of the emergency order announced by Abbas after the violent takeover of Gaza by Abbas.
According to the Basic Law of the Palestinian autonomous government, the state of emergency may not exceed 30 days without the consent of the parliament, but the autonomous parliament is now in a state of paralysis.

These proposals seek to break the deadlock over the last six years of the Doha Round and to bring about a compromise between the 150 members of the WTO.
WTO Secretary-General Lamy described these proposals as "a fair and reasonable basis for achieving lofty goals, balance, and development as a guiding agreement."
Lamy said, "member states will not be entirely satisfied with the content of the proposal. However, the current problem of differences is less than the issue of consensus."
He called for intensive negotiations in the coming weeks.

Worry about buying and selling British brand name environmentally-friendly bags in Indonesia
The agent said today that in view of the disorder caused by the shopping rush in Hong Kong earlier this month, Indonesia has cancelled the sale of British brand name environmentally-friendly bags.
"In view of the events in Hong Kong, we have abolished the listing of environmentally-friendly bags in Hong Kong.
If the people got into a bag of some 140,000 rupees (about NT $494), then it would have no value. "
Thousands of Hong Kong people gathered at the sales store on the 6th and were preparing to buy a limited amount of green bags designed by the British designer aniyah indmarch, with "I am not a plastic bag". However, the stores refused to open the door, causing the scene to get out of control.

The countdown to the hostage crisis South Korea talks directly with the Taliban
The Taliban in Afghanistan have abducted 23 South Korean hostages and set a deadline for today's sunset, demanding that South Korea withdraw its troops from Albania; otherwise, they will kill the hostages.
As time goes by, the situation has developed positively. South Korean officials have started negotiations with the Taliban for the first time today.
However, at the same time, the Taliban organization said that another kidnapped German hostage was very weak and began to fall into a coma and lose consciousness.
The Taliban called on Germany and South Korea to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan and demanded that these hostages be held in exchange for the 33 guerrillas imprisoned by the Afghan government.
"We have been able to contact the South Korean representatives directly through clan elders," said a Taliban spokesman at an unknown location, "said a spokesman for the Taliban.

It is hard to get a consensus on the maritime disputes, and the military talks between the two Koreas are unhappy.
Due to the demarcation of maritime boundaries, the three-day high-level military talks between North and South Korea broke up today.
The talks held in Panmunjom, the border city, today entered the final day of the agenda. The chief representative of North Korea, Kim wing-che, said, "We have come to the conclusion that these inconclusive talks will no longer be needed."
Kim wing-che, whose face and face was obviously unhappy, criticized South Korea for deliberately avoiding the demarcation of the new maritime boundary to replace the previous discussion of the "North Limit Line."
He said that the "north limit line" was not legal.
The "northern limit line" located in the Yellow Sea was established after the end of the Korean War in 1953. However, in recent years it has become the focus of dispute between the two Koreas, and North Korea has even refused to admit it.
North Korea claimed that South Korean warships violated the waters in violation of the law, causing tension; South Korea claimed that this allegation was unfounded.
Conflicts broke out in local waters in June 1999, resulting in the deaths of dozens of North Korean sailors.
Similar clashes came out again in June 2002. Six South Koreans were unfortunately killed.
US finance minister's visit to China: environmental protection and exchange rate the focus of concern
US Treasury Secretary Powell arrived in China yesterday, and the United States is making every effort to persuade China to further carry out the necessary economic reform and environmental protection work.
US diplomats indicated that Powell would first go to the city of Qinghai, capital of the North West Region of China, for a visit.
China is currently carrying out a series of environmental protection plans near the largest water lake in Qinghai Province.
Powell went to Beijing today to discuss with Chinese officials the promotion of the "US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue" process, which was launched last year.
The strategic economic dialogue between the United States and China mainly discusses economic and environmental issues, and the most important issue is the issue of the Renminbi exchange rate.
The US-China trade deficit is rapidly increasing, and pressure within the United States has gradually risen. Congressmen are prepared to take retaliatory action against their so-called China unfair trade policy.
Last week, the US Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly passed a motion calling on the Ministry of Finance to identify the list of countries where the currency exchange rate is "fundamentally wrong", thus opening the door to potential economic sanctions against Beijing.
US Congress members said that the underestimation of the Renminbi has made the price of China's exports to the United States extremely cheap, adding to the imbalance between the United States and China, and the US trade deficit with China reached US $232.5 billion last year.

However, the 44-year-old muri隳 did not intend to contribute his entire life to football. He said he would retire before the age of 60. He did not imagine that he would be in the same old age.
"I have already made a promise to my wife that I will not go to the age of 70, just like robsen and frgsen."
Muri隳 frankly said, "by the age of 60, I want to completely bid farewell to the soccer circles.
I have too many things that I can't do now and wait for me to do. "
"I don't want to be a football adviser or a technical director, for example, bardamo or Saki.
I do not want to play such a role.
I don't want to be the chairman of a club. I just want to say goodbye to football. "

Experts believe that the insurance QDII will not divert funds from domestic stock markets in the short term.
Chinanews.com, July 30.
According to a report by the China Securities newspaper, a few days ago, the "Interim Measures for the administration of foreign investment in insurance funds" was released, and insurance funds had more room for use in the capital market.
Liu Lefei, chief investment officer of China Life Company, believes that the appreciation of renminbi and the favorable domestic capital market will not result in large-scale foreign investment through foreign exchange. This also means that the insurance QDII will not divert funds from domestic stock markets in the short term.
The report said that many insurance companies hold the same view.
Experts said that since currently there is no market for Renminbi derivatives, the insurance agency does not have enough means to avoid risks. Therefore, the time for large-scale purchase of foreign currency is not yet ripe.
Liu Lefei said that in the long run, in terms of asset allocation, foreign investment should have a certain proportion in the overall configuration of insurance companies.
However, in view of the greater pressure to appreciate the Renminbi at present, China Life will mainly make use of its own foreign exchange funds to carry out overseas investment.
Foreign investment in foreign currency purchases should be treated with caution in the present circumstances.

Judicial intervention in the election of Taiwan's "magistrates' courts" denied and explained
Chinanews, July 31. Chen Shui-bian questioned on the 30th that judicial personnel on the island were trying to get involved in the election of leaders in Taiwan.
Gao Jinzhi, Taiwan's "chief executive of the court," said on the same day that the current performance of judges on the island was not in line with what Chen Shui-bian said, and asked Chen Shui-bian to explain his statement.
According to a report by Taiwan's "United Daily News," Chen Shui-bian called on judges, prosecutors or investigators to intervene, influence or even attempt to influence the election activities of candidates of various parties because of political factors or election considerations. He said he hoped that this phenomenon would not exist in Taiwan, but it might be very difficult.
In response to Chen Shui-bian's doubts, the "president of the Judicial Yuan" of Taiwan's "president of the judiciary" did not respond to this, and the "secretary general" has appointed Gao Jinzhi to speak on behalf of the "court of justice."
Kao Chin-chih says that both the basic law of Taiwan and the "Code of judges" have expressly stated that judges should go beyond the party and should not participate in political party activities. The judges are very cautious in observing the relevant restrictions, and the "court" believes that the judges are doing a very good job.
Kao Chin-chih, for example, pointed out that a few years ago, Chang Sheng, a judge of the Kaohsiung high school, took part in the katagalan school curriculum.
Zhang Sheng, who once wanted to participate in the Democratic Progressive Party, also decided to give up because he was in charge of running for the election, and finally decided to give up.
According to Gao Jinzhi, if it is a trial in a particular case, and if there is relief at the trial level, it cannot be inferred that the judge has no political intention on the basis of the outcome of the judgment.
Germany proposes to reduce entry threshold for professionals
This paper, Berlin, July 1 (reporter Wang Huaicheng)
German Minister of Education and Research Shawan said a few days ago that Germany should lower the restrictions on the introduction of foreign professionals in the immigration law and solve the problem of the shortage of professionals in Germany by increasing the import of foreign talent.
According to the OECD report, the number of labour in Germany between the ages of 15 and 64 will decline year by year by the year 2010.
If there are not enough migrants, the German labour force will be reduced by 6 per cent by the year 2020.
However, reports from organizations such as the German Employers' Federation and the German Engineers' Association show that there is a greater gap between engineers and professionals in the current labor market in Germany.
According to data from the German Federal Labour Office, in May this year, the supply of engineers in the German labor market was about 1.27 million, and the supply of technicians was about 9,600.
In order to protect the employment of local people, Germany has set a higher threshold for the introduction of foreign talent.
According to the German immigration act, professionals of non-EU countries whose annual income is not less than 8.55 million euros will not be able to obtain employment and residence permits in Germany.
Saudi Arabia proposes to reduce the limit to 40,000 to 60,000 euros.

There are "theoretical circles" and "substantive circles" in the law. The former consists mainly of "abstract acts" such as legal teaching and research, while the latter are more "specific acts" such as litigation, legal advice, legal services, and so on.
Over a long period of time, the "legal circles" and the "practical community" have been characterized by the fact that the "practical community" lacks the necessary legal qualities, and that the "practical community" 's criticism of the "theoretical circles" has pointed to the theory that "theoretical guidance has not been put into practice."
In the case of such a division of labour, what the law can do is to maintain neutrality and not to give strong support to any party.
However, the "licensing system" in the "lawyer's Law" has objectively endorsed the judgment that the legal "theoretical circle" should be higher than that of the law.
As a matter of fact, some experts and scholars who engage in the research and teaching of purely legal theory, such as legal history, international law, and so on, are no more advanced than legal practice.
In this way, the "licensing system" has undoubtedly created a "bad mouth" that has had an extremely bad influence on the qualification of the law.
Such superstition, such as expert opinion and expert panel discussion, often affects and even rejects court decisions. This is also a direct manifestation of such superstition.

The applicant may choose Shanghai, Tianjin, and Dalian to register as a port of registry for the registration of ships.
The United Kingdom lowered the terror attack alert level
This paper, London, July 5 (Reporter: Guo Lin)
On the 4th, the British government lowered the terrorist attack alert level from the highest level to "serious" level. This means that the terrorist attack in Britain will not happen soon, but the attack is still "extremely possible."
Currently, the British police have turned the scope of the investigation to India and Australia.
In view of the fact that the eight terrorist suspects arrested were working in the medical system, the government would conduct an urgent review of the background of the immigrants who had entered the medical system.
It is learned that nearly 90 000 people working in the British public health care system are eligible for medical treatment overseas.
Prime Minister Brown also asked for an investigation into the background of the applicants for high-tech immigrants, and the employer or the relevant agency would be asked to provide background information on the applicants.
Public places don't let the vendors get trouble
When you go out to travel, the plan is to relax, clean, and be able to enjoy the fruits of natural beauty and social civilization to the greatest extent possible.
Many people are able to travel within the country. Many people are faced with this kind of worry. They are intercepted and intercepted by vendors and intermediaries in public places.
Whether it is a car or a train, get out of the car and get out of the car, they will always be hit by small vendors and some undocumented intermediaries.
It's not the selling of eggs, which is sold in newspapers and magazines. In other words, there are many undocumented intermediaries who introduce food and accommodation, and even sell fake invoices.
If you don't accept, he can chase for several hundred meters. If you do not succeed, then you will have a tendency to die.
In some scenic areas, many visitors have the same feeling.
If you don't get into the door, people come to sell things such as tourist souvenirs and small handicrafts.
After entering the door, the situation became even more serious.
There have been media reports that many foreign tourists to Xi'an are full of praise for the scenic spots and scenic spots in Xi'an, but they find it incomprehensible to allow a large number of small vendors to sell.
Public places such as stations and scenic areas, which are places of travel and leisure, should pay attention to the orderly, peaceful and harmonious environment in which people can enjoy a comfortable and comfortable environment.
The free movement of vendors has confused the mood of the visitors. Objectively, they have damaged public order in these public places, created visual pollution and environmental pollution. At the same time, they also provided the criminals with the conditions and opportunities to stir up trouble.
What is important is that these public places are the windows of the building of the local spiritual civilization. It is not only an image problem, but also an impact on the development of the local economy.
Just imagine, if you want to be a strong tourist industry, you can use such a chaotic situation of tourism to welcome the guests from south to north. Who is willing to come and who will dare to come?
How can your tourism economy be effective?
With the arrival of the peak tourist season, it should be said that it is an urgent task to create a civilized tourism environment for tourists from northern China.
Public places are not the market, and the conduct of small business hawkers should be regulated, and illegal activities should be resolutely eliminated. Illegal activities should be resolutely dealt with.
Only when there is a civilized and orderly environment can the visitors be happy and come back.
In a word, public places don't let the vendors get trouble.
"voluntary retirement protection award" does not stand up to deliberation
As a reward for 12 families on their own initiative, the streets of Beijing's eastern district have been set up to distribute refrigerators and other items.
(Beijing News, July 10)
The author is happy for the improvement of the lives of these families. However, in terms of the formulation of "taking the initiative to withdraw," There is also the practice of "giving awards", but this is a complicated matter.
The deputy director of the local neighborhood office said: "with regard to issues such as fraud and low insurance, encouraging voluntary retirement is an example for other low policy holders."
This example is indeed worth promoting if we encourage other low-income workers to get out of their predicament through their own efforts.
In the work of distinguishing between genuine and fake policy holders, more reliance should be placed on the law.
Relevant departments should strengthen the obligations of low policy holders when enjoying low security: if they report on the changes in family personnel and income, report on the employment situation, receive regular reviews, and so on, and the departments concerned should step up supervision and inspection.
After all, "retirement under the law" is a long-term measure.
Where is the physical reward given by the street to the retired family, and who is going to foot the bill?
The streets, as government organizations at the level of government, are funded by financial allocations.
And what about the taxpayers' money?
On the one hand, the families that have withdrawn from the low-income families have proved that they have a certain "self-sufficiency" capability. On the other hand, does it mean that those who have applied for low insurance are still in existence?
The government's financial allocation, which is referred to as "save money", should be provided in a timely manner.
If Liu Gang is willing to be a servant, then he will be more credible.
On 10 July, after taking office, Liu Gang, secretary of the Party Committee of the township party committee and secretary of the municipal party committee of Mulan Township, was accepted for the fourth time after taking office, and the satisfaction rate reached 97 percent.
In the dialogue between reporters and Liu Gang, Liu Gang defined himself as a "servant."
(yesterday's Beijing News)
The "service" in the mouth of Liu Gang may be more real and more convincing than the "service" of some appointed cadres.
The greatest advantage of the appointment system is that the former is mainly composed of ordinary party members and the masses. The latter is mainly appointed by the higher authorities, and the direction of the source of power determines that the former must give top priority to the people.
The source of power and accountability is the fundamental factor in determining the conduct of those elected.
Some people doubt that such a "democratic Review" is more like a "democracy show."
My view is that with this kind of "democratic appraisal", it is better than nothing.
Taking into account the history and current situation of grass-roots democratic political construction in China, I believe that the introduction of direct elections is already a major breakthrough. Democratic deliberation is an important part of this initiative and should not be underestimated for the promotion of democratic political construction at the grassroots level.
India is expected to elect its first female president analysts, saying it is more likely to be elected; female voters hope to improve the status of women.
On 23 June, prior to the completion of the presidential candidate document, Patil took up a total of 10 pairs of hands.
The presidential election of India opened on the 19th, and the new president will be created between the current Vice President, Mr. Sheka watts, and the Governor of Rajasthan of Rajasthan in the recent past.
Patil is the first female presidential candidate in Indian history. If she is elected, she will become the first woman president in the history of India.
Patil is a candidate for the ruling party congress of the ruling party. He is from the opposition party of the opposition party.
Since the National Congress Party has an advantage in the presidential electoral college, the media and the general public have speculated that it is more likely that Patil will be elected.
Palir, 72, is the Governor of Rajasthan.
She was born to a lawyer. She joined the parliament in 1985 and had a wealth of political experience. She was well received by the government when he was governor of Rajasthan.
She is also committed to social welfare and is the honorary president of many cultural, educational and social welfare organizations.
Analysts point out that the reason why Patil became a candidate is because she has always been loyal to the president of the Indian National Congress, Sonia Gandhi.
In India, the Gandhi family has a long-term control of the ruling Congress Party.
Patil was supported by a large number of female voters, and female voters believed that Patil would rebuild a female image and improve the status of women in India, where the concept of discrimination against women is serious.
According to the constitution, India is a federal state, and the president is the name of the head of state and the commander of the armed forces, and does not represent any party organization, but more is a symbol.

US supports Palestinian government's expulsion of extremists
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) The following is a list of major world events scheduled for July 22 to July 22.
US President Bush said on the 21st that the United States will give its full support to the Pakistani government to drive al-Qa'idah and Taliban extremists out of the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
In a routine weekly broadcast on the same day, Bush said that according to the new US intelligence, al-Qa'idah has found a "safe haven" in the border areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
He expressed "great concern" about this.
Bush said that the United States will continue to support Pakistani President Musharraf and believes that Musharraf will persist in fighting al Qaeda and Taliban militants.
According to a recent national intelligence assessment report published by the United States, the "al-Qaeda" organization of Muslim armed groups, especially bin Laden, still poses a continuing threat to the United States.
In September last year, Musharraf and a group of tribal leaders in northern Pakistan reached an agreement on guarding against the residual forces of the Taliban and the activities of al-Qa'idah members, which failed to achieve the expected results.
These tribal leaders "are unwilling or incapable" to defend the security of the region on their own.
In his earlier taped speech, Bush said that Musharraf is taking active steps to correct this mistake.
The US hopes that the North Korean nuclear issue will be fully implemented.
This paper, WASHINGTON, July 24 (reporter Xu Qisheng)
US Assistant Secretary of State and US chief representative of the six-party talks on the North Korea nuclear issue said on the 23rd that the six-party talks on the North Korea nuclear issue held last week were very important. The meeting made real progress for the first time, but it was only a "preliminary action" to implement the agreement.
The United States very much hopes that the "9.19 Joint Statement" and the 2.13 common document on the North Korea nuclear issue can be fully implemented in 2008.
On the same day, Hill said at a press conference that in order to achieve the goal of a complete resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue in 2008, North Korea needs to declare all its nuclear programs before the end of the year and realize the effectiveness of nuclear facilities.
He hoped that the parties concerned would fully implement the agreement reached at the six-party talks on the North Korea nuclear issue within one year.
Hill also said that while holding talks on the issue of security and energy, the US and North Korean working groups will discuss, respectively, the issues to be resolved in the bilateral relations between the United States and the DPRK and the DPRK.
Climate change leads to rapid downsizing of the Alpine glacier
This paper, Geneva, July 29 (reporter Liu Jun)
The long-term tracking study of the glacier experts of the Swiss Academy of Sciences found that between 1850 and 2005, more than 1,800 glaciers in Switzerland were shrinking at a rate of 3 per cent per year.
The heat wave in 2003 alone has caused the Alpine glacier to melt by 1.8%.
Experts believe that by the year 2100, if the global temperature rises by 3 degree Celsius, the glacier will be reduced by 80 percent compared to the present, up 5 degrees Celsius and the glacier will be completely eliminated.
Alic glacier, the longest glacier in Europe, has been included in the UNESCO world natural heritage list, but has been reduced by 100 metres in the year 2005 to 2006, and the protection of the natural environment has become a matter of urgency.
The map is about 23 kilometres long.

A total of ten years of Hong Kong's return to Hong Kong
On 1 July, the alarm bell was once again sounded at the Memorial Hall of the Nanjing Jinghai Temple.
Through the "link" to the mainland and Hong Kong, the people of Nanjing and the people of Hong Kong, together with Hong Kong compatriots, jointly celebrate the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
Ten years ago, at 12: 00 a.m. on July 1, there were 155 alarm bells ringing over the clock tower of the Nanjing Jinghai Temple Memorial Hall, which was a farewell to the history of humiliation of Hong Kong Island.
In front of the small memorial hall, people from all walks of life in Nanjing came together. They said that they would ring the clock through their own hands to warn themselves and future generations not to forget history.
"The alarm bell was 1.842 meters high, and in 1842 it was the time when the" Nanjing Treaty "was signed during the outbreak of the Opium War.
It is 1.97 meters high and 1997 is the year of Hong Kong's reunification, "he said.
At that time, the director of the police, Wang Fengling, explained: "The five '10,000' characters revolve around the Bell, and the whole bronze bell is used as the" Oriental Pearl of the motherland. "In the end, it is the" Pearl of the Orient "of the motherland.

Two Jordanian men sentenced for plotting attacks on Americans
Two Jordanian men were sentenced by the Jordanian State Security Court for plotting attacks on Americans in Jordan.
The two men, who were 25 years of age, were sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for forced labour and the other, Mohammed hadapu, sentenced to three years' imprisonment for forced labour.
According to the court, Hu was also charged with illegal possession of firearms and the police found an assault rifle during a search of his home.
The court had originally decided to sentence him to life imprisonment, taking into account the possibility of giving him a "rehabilitation" and reducing his sentence to eight years.
The indictment said that after the Iraq war broke out, they decided to revenge the Muslims who were "bullied by the Americans" and then planned to attack Americans living in Jordan.
In August 2006, they locked up an American living in the suburbs of the Jordanian capital of Amman, but was arrested by police before carrying out an attack on them.
The identity of the American was not disclosed in the indictment.
The indictment also alleged that the two defendants had plans to attack other Americans, but did not disclose any specific details.

A large increase in the number of reported bad reactions caused by diabetes medicine
According to a report by the US media on the 15th, the number of bad reaction reports, such as heart disease caused by anti-diabetes medicine, has recently shown a sharp upward trend in the United States.
The Food and Drug Administration of the United States issued a safety warning in May this year, suggesting that diabetics should be cautious because scientists published a study in the New England medical journal on 21 May, saying that such selling drugs would greatly increase the incidence and mortality of patients with heart disease.
As a result, the safety of Wendy has been closely followed by doctors and patients.
The statistics show that within about a month after the issuance of the safety warning, the United States administration of medicine received a report of an adverse reaction from 357 texts, of which 38 were deaths.
In January and February this year, the authority received only 50 and 73 adverse reports respectively.
These bad responses light up to the sudden death of a heart attack.
However, the drug experts of the United States administration of medicine believe that it is still too early to come to a conclusion that Wen Di is unsafe.
The authority will hold a hearing on the safety of Wendy on July 30.
Wendy, published in 1999, is a kind of insulin, which applies to the treatment of diabetes.
Some 6 million diabetics have been or are being used in the world.
The manufacturer of Wendy, England, has always believed that Wendy is safe, and that "the harm is greater than the harm" for the patients.

Solana reiterated the EU's support for Abbas and the Palestinian people.
He said: The four parties involved in the Middle East issue (the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia) will hold a meeting on the 19th to discuss the resumption of the peace process in the Middle East.
Solana said that the EU has a positive attitude toward the deployment of an international force in Gaza, but it also needs to discuss it with other parties, especially with the United Nations.

US Defense Department rethinking plan to reduce US troops in Europe
US Defense Department officials said on the 23rd that due to changes in the Iraq war and the world situation, the US Department of Defense is rethinking the plan to reduce the number of US troops stationed in Europe by about half in 2002.
The US media quoted an official of the Ministry of Defense as saying that since the Iraq war is still under way and the US relations with Russia and Iran have deteriorated, the leadership of the Ministry of Defense has raised questions about the feasibility of reducing the European garrison plan.
In 2002, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld announced that the United States will reduce the number of troops stationed in Europe from the original 11.30 million to 710,000 by 2012 in order to build a new military force that is "small and small."
At present, the total military strength of the US military in Europe has dropped to 100,000.
However, in June this year, kradok, commander of the European Command of the US military, submitted a report to current Defense Secretary Gates, calling into question the above-mentioned reduction plan.
The report says that while the US military in Europe is reducing its military strength, many troops have been transferred to Iraq and Afghanistan to fight, resulting in a shortage of US troops stationed in Europe, so that they are unable to carry out normal cooperation with their European allies.
The report recommends an end to the plan to reduce the number of troops stationed in Europe.
According to experts in the United States, the above phenomena show that the delay in the Iraq war has disrupted the original adjustment plan of the US military.

Three main functions of modern military uniform
The first is the identification function.
It is important to distinguish between the armed forces of different countries, different arms and services, the military, and the people.
In the armies of more than 100 countries in the world, although the use of military uniforms is basically the same, none of the two countries' military uniforms are identical.
Second, it is a symbolic function.
To a certain extent, military uniform is a reflection of the spiritual and national characteristics of a country. It is also a concentrated embodiment of the combat capability of a country's armed forces and the cultivation of military personnel.
In the three major categories of military uniform in dress, standing, and training, there can be no more than a full demonstration of the power of the country and the military.
Third is the protective function.
With the rapid development of new and new weapons and equipment, it has become the most important issue for the development of military uniforms.

CHENGDU, July 3 (Xinhua)
He said: "We can live in apartment houses and benefit from the determination and determination of the units of the Party Committee of the brigade."
Today, more than ten cadres in a certain communications training unit of the Chengdu Military Region are very happy. They have shown great admiration and gratitude to the Party Committee of the Party Committee of the party committee for solving difficult problems.
In the past few years, with the turnover of personnel, some of the houses of this brigade were overoccupied, resulting in difficulties for the working cadres in housing, and the officers and men were more concerned about this.
The brigade has also cleared a number of houses, all of which, due to all sorts of resistance, have made the problem all the more difficult.
"As long as you dare to be more realistic and reasonable, there is no problem that cannot be solved."
After a consensus was reached at the new session of the Party Committee, the main leaders personally came forward to thoroughly clean up all the irregularities.
At the same time, they expressed their hope that the relevant personnel would take into consideration the overall situation. On the other hand, they expressed the firm determination and principled position of the Party Committee.
For those who have housing elsewhere and who are unwilling to withdraw from their homes, the Party Committee organs have contacted their units in a timely manner and have taken corresponding measures to encourage them to take the initiative to work with the troops.
After two months of detailed work, all households in the quartering areas who were in excess of the level of housing had to move out as scheduled, and the working cadres in the brigade had been allocated housing in accordance with the regulations.
The Party Committee of the brigade has been brave enough to deal with the hard work style. It has also created a chain effect. As a result, several cadres who were unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization have now also indicated that they are complying with the decision of the organization.

BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua)
Zhang Shun, reporter of the Central Military Commission and commander of the air force commander of the air force, met with the chief of staff of the Bangladesh Air Force, ziio Rahman, and his party in Beijing today.
He said that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Bangladesh, relations between the two countries have been developing smoothly, high-level contacts have been frequent, and friendly exchanges and cooperation in various fields have been constantly strengthened.
Whether in international affairs or in the construction of their respective countries, the two countries have mutual trust, mutual support, mutual help, and close cooperation.
China appreciates and thanks Bangladesh for its support to China on issues such as Taiwan, human rights, and Tibet.
He expressed the hope that the friendly relations between the armed forces of the two countries will be further enhanced, and the friendly cooperation between the two armed forces will be enhanced to a new level.
Qi said that Bangladesh will make positive efforts to further develop friendly exchanges and cooperation between the two armed forces, especially the air forces of the two countries.
He reiterated that the government of Bangladesh will, as always, adhere to the one-China policy.
Prior to the meeting, he held a welcoming ceremony in the early morning.
The Chinese delegation arrived in Beijing on July 8 for an official goodwill visit to China at the invitation of the Chinese People's Republic of China.
The Chinese military network
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) with effect from 1 August, all units of the whole army will change their military uniforms.
This evening, the Chinese military network specially invited Chen Jun, deputy director of the General Assembly bureau of the Ministry of military equipment, and one of the senior engineers of the general military equipment research institute, the Chinese military network, and foreign friends inside and outside the army to talk about the background and the development process of the new military uniform.
The two guests are direct participants in the design and development of the 07 style military uniform.
When talking about changes in the new military uniform, they explained that the 07 type of military uniform was designed on the basis of every change in military uniform, especially in the 97 type of military uniform. As many as several hundred improvements were made in seven areas, including the series, format, and format of military uniforms.
The greatest feature of the 07 type of military uniform is that it has embodied the requirements of a series of series, power, and humanity, and has enabled our army's military uniform to meet the standards of coordination, variety, and variety of the services of the armed forces. This indicates that the level of military uniform in our army has achieved a historical leap.
The two guests also had extensive exchanges with net friends on issues such as the variety, style, shapes, and wearing of new military uniforms.
The interview was jointly organized by the China Military network and the China Network, the new wave network, and Tom Online.
The Jinzhou people's military Ministry has set up a platform to upgrade the quality of special military cadres.
According to a report by Cao family and Zhu Zhenbin: on 18 June, at the special training course for cadres at the Jinjiang City of Jiangsu Province, Lu Yuqing, minister of the armed forces of western China, gave a lecture on "winning a psychological war under the conditions of informationization."
This is a new change brought about by the fact that the ministry of human affairs and the people's armed forces of the city have actually placed pressure on the cadres of the special forces, and have made great efforts to improve the comprehensive quality of cadres and cadres.
At the beginning of this year, the Party Committee of the Ministry of Military Affairs of the People's Republic of China discovered that some of the special military cadres had been in office for a long time and had too many positions, and did not concentrate their efforts on armed work.
To this end, they have focused on training, training, and training of local Party schools on a regular basis. They have conducted regular training for cadres at the local level, and made efforts to solve problems such as the narrow knowledge of the cadres and the quality of their business.
In conjunction with the work of the center, they are bold enough to hand over tasks and pressure on cadres and cadres, and improve their ability to work through their posts.
At the same time, they have actively coordinated the local organization departments and jointly formulated the "plan for the appointment of special cadres for employment", which clearly stipulates that the armed ministers must enter the ranks of party committees at the same level and no longer hold other positions.
We have set up a mechanism for the adjustment and exchange of cadres. They have promptly adjusted the exchange of cadres who are too old and unable to adapt to the grassroots armed forces, and have promoted the use of those comrades who have a good overall quality and ability to work.
Not long ago, Chen yi-sung, director of the armed forces department of the new century Ship Building Company Limited, led the technical unit of the people's militia to fill the gap in the domestic void and was upgraded to the director of the armed forces department of the company.
We still have to do well in the first place.
As far as the outcome of the competition is concerned, the score of 2 to 2 is reasonable and acceptable to the Chinese team. The key lies in the course of the competition, which is regrettable.
If the Iranian team takes the lead in 2: 0, then the Chinese team will equal the score. Then the feeling of the Chinese fans will definitely be different and the morale will be very long. Unfortunately, the opposite is the case.
It can be said that it is an old problem in the Chinese team.
The Chinese team often doesn't know how to kick a ball or not. The general view of the Chinese team is that the psychological quality of Chinese players is weak.
This is indeed one reason why the Chinese team cannot be "hospice".
However, judging from the Chinese team's match today, it seems not to be all right.
Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao jiyi, Zheng Zhi, and others played the ball in Europe.
The Chinese team, unfortunately, was forced to Ping by the Iranian team for fear that it would be ineffective in deploying troops.
Under the backward situation, the Iranian team changed into two people, and the scene immediately improved.
In the second half of the Chinese team, three players were changed, but the result was not good.
To overcome these problems, we must find out the root causes of the problem.
As long as the problem is found, it is probably not difficult to find a way out.
Fearing that they would be in a desperate situation, they would be afraid of going to the doctor.
If things go on like this, the Chinese team will kick in more competitions, and the old problems will continue to be committed. It cannot be said that everyone is looking forward to the kick.
Ministry of Public Security gives second class merit to Guangdong Border Defense Corps Hospital
Staff reporter, Shenzhen, July 18
Li Guoliang and Huang Qi reported that over the years, while doing a good job in providing medical protection to the troops, the hospitals of the Guangdong Border Defense Corps have tried their best to help the people in need.

This measure has already benefited more than 12,000 peasant workers.
Since the beginning of 2003, the hospital has also launched a large-scale love and goodwill clinic. Eight times, it has organized eye care personnel to go to Tibet, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Qinghai to "give light and health to health". There are nearly 3,000 cases of cataract operations free of charge.

The 07-style clothing of the armed police will be changed over a period of three years.
Before August 1, 2007, police officers, civilian cadres, and the national flag guard, the military orchestra, and the culture group changed their formal dress.
In May 2008, the soldiers and students of other forces will be replaced by the spring and autumn service, the summer vacation, and the sign dress.
In October 2008, police officers were changing their winter clothes and standing overcoat.
In December 2009, soldiers were changing their winter clothes for the soldiers.
The training is carried out in a gradual and gradual manner starting from 2008.
A certain base of the second artillery force begins operation in the education and Coordination Zone.
This paper is reported by Hsueh Bing Jian and reporter Xu Yeqing: it is difficult for small scattered units to organize educational organizations, and their resources are scarce, and they will become a part of history at a certain base of the Second Artillery Corps.
The reporter recently learned that after six months of trial, the base issued the "implementation plan for the implementation of the ideological and political education program," covering all the ideological and political education cooperative areas of all the small scattered units of the base.
In order to promote the effective implementation of the "Outline of ideological and political education," at the beginning of the year, the base organized forces to conduct in-depth research on the current state of ideological and political education in small and remote areas. The key issues of influencing and restricting the time, personnel, and effects of education began to form a new type of education model.
The specific approach of the Coordination Zone is to break down the establishment of the unit by designating a brigade level unit to take the lead in the relatively concentrated area of the unit, and to make a unified plan for the theme education.
Through a combination of rotation and competitive appointment, the education forces should be deployed in a unified manner; the local educational hardware will be used in a unified manner; the information data and educational experience of various units are shared, and a typical tour report will be organized on a regular basis for the officers and soldiers to share their experiences.
Full-time education liaison officers and part-time educational information collectors have been set up in each area.
On this basis, the various regions have also set up problems seeking assistance, major educational topics, information on emergency thinking, and assessment and appraisal system.
Zhang Xingmin, director of the Political Department of the base, told the reporter that the establishment of a political education Coordination Zone has reduced the waste of educational resources and deepened the educational results.
Some political teachers fear that they should take the initiative to learn new knowledge and explore new methods of education.
The educated officers and men also took positive steps to digest the contents of the education, fearing that the discussion could be carried out in front of the officers and men of the neighboring countries.
As a result, the enthusiasm of educators and educators has been effectively stimulated.
A whole portion of the infirmary places in a certain repair Brigade of the North Sea Fleet will be given to the soldiers.
Staff report by Zhang Jun and Liu Hongjun: on 17 July, under the leadership of Zhang Weiliang, deputy chief engineer of a certain repair Brigade of the North Sea Fleet, a group of 31 soldiers who had long worked in the repair line happily stepped onto a train in Beidaihe.
Petty Officer Wang Xiangming happily told the author, "the leadership of the brigade is concerned about the soldiers. We are deeply moved. After we come back, we will certainly redouble our efforts."
It is the first time that we organize grassroots soldiers in convalescence.
Not long ago, Captain Yao Qingsheng went to the grass-roots level to see that some of the soldiers responsible for the repair work carried out equipment maintenance work at high temperature, which was deeply moved by Yao Qingsheng.
The party committee should take care of the soldiers and be responsible for the health of the soldiers.
After studying the Party Committee's study, the party committee made a decision and assigned the whole part of the infirmary places assigned to the brigade to the soldiers who work on the front line.
The opening of a certain unit in the Jinan Military Region has made the "hot spots" not hot.
This report
Wang Weiqin and special correspondent Li decamp reported: on 25 July, the author at a unit of a unit of a unit in the Jinan Military Region saw that a piece of public announcements on important issues such as bidding for army projects, financial expenses, promotion of cadres, and joining the party to join the party were conspicuously hung in the windows.
According to political Commissar Su Chengsen, this is a concrete measure taken by the department to promote the open system of work.
At the beginning of this year, the Party Committee of the army, in order to strengthen the building of a clean Party style and a clean government, has formulated measures such as "two-way supervision at the grass-roots level" and "sensitive issues," requiring all officers and soldiers to make decisions after listening to the opinions of officers and men at the grassroots level.
The unit has set up a suggestion box and a publicity column to open a "message board" on the local area network to extensively collect opinions and suggestions.
At the beginning of the year, the Party Committee organs extensively solicited the opinions of officers and soldiers and then issued tender information to conduct open tenders.
It has saved money and won the support of officers and soldiers.
Openness and fairness have led to the formation of a good atmosphere at the grassroots level.
In this unit, the grassroots companies, regardless of whether they are large enough to determine the sensitive issues of hot spots or the daily expenses of personal visits to relatives, and the daily expenses of the catering accounts, adhere to regular publicity and publicity, and voluntarily accept supervision by the masses.

BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) at the end of next year's Olympic Games, Beijing is expected to turn into a sea of flowers.

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, I am worried about the effect of your "deadline for fighting corruption."
Posted [SMS] [tables] from 2007-07-02 14: 10: 10.
The Central Discipline Inspection Commission has set a deadline of 30 May for corrupt elements throughout the country for a period of one month, that is, until 30 June.
I couldn't help but smile. When the police caught the thief and told the thief a month in advance, he immediately took the initiative to be frank; otherwise, there was such an anti-corruption campaign in the world.
Does this not mean that the corrupt officials should be told to run away in advance so that the evidence can be transferred quickly?
What is the intention?
If this is not the case, it would be impossible to tell.
Even if this is really the case, what will be the effect?
Is it possible to contain and deter corrupt officials?
We do not rule out the possibility that some of them will take the initiative to account for them.
We are not saying that the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection's fight against corruption is very limited. Whether the results are significant or not, I am afraid the other role would have been achieved.
That is, all local corrupt officials are willing to express their gratitude to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.
In a month's time, it would be enough to make a quick transfer of funds.
If I were a corrupt official, I would definitely do it this way, and I would never take the initiative to declare it.
The corrupt officials are glad to see this. Ha ha, thank you, Ah......
The people are really puzzled. What is going on in the fight against corruption? How can it be so difficult and decisive?
What will be the effect of this kind of anti-corruption work?
In short, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, I am worried about the effect of your "deadline for fighting corruption."
The fact that land is not privatized is my bottom line.
From 2007-07 - 02 10: 34: 39 [SMS] [tables].
The fact that land is not privatized is my bottom line.
I think I am a person who is not easily angry. At least, I feel that way.
It has always been sensible and calm to speak in the forum, and very few of them have lost their sense of reason.
I have always maintained a high degree of confidence and ardent expectations of the Party Central Committee. No matter how the reform measures are not in line with my concept, I can accept it and treat them as one of the "characteristics."
But if the land begins to be privatized (or in disguise), then all this will lose the foundation of existence.
The land and resources are the greatest social resources.
Working people and land resources are the fundamentals of a country.
As long as the nature of land resources remains unchanged, the nature of this country will be very difficult to change. Once the nature of land resources has changed, basically everything has changed.
I am not a member of the Communist Party, but I remember clearly that I had the following oath: "Love the motherland, love the people, study hard, and prepare for the cause of communism!"
"to study diligently, to work actively, to bear the hardship, and to work hard for the cause of communism," he said.
Like me, once I took the oath of saying, "We are the successors of socialism," If you are not so shameless, then you should remember your oath.
If you have betrayed your own oath, Please stand up and walk away from the side of the "Communist Party."
Of course, I hope that all these worries are superfluous, and I hope that I can always remain sensible and calm.
We must remember that "we are the successor of socialism."
What can we do if there are no classes?
A generation of people, the feelings of two times.
In the previous period, someone pointed out that people at the age of 30 had the support of Mao.
Was replaced by 20 years of age.
In fact, people of this age group have never experienced the Mao Zedong era. They do not know whether the people who raised this issue were whether their brain was filled with water or their congenital brain.
In the cities, those who had the most say in the Mao Zedong era were the people who had experienced those years, the people who had lived through those years, that is to say, people born between 1950 and 1960.
After they were born, their parents participated in the movement and did not share the love of their children.
When they need nutrition, they just catch up with three years of natural disasters and suffer from hunger.
When they started to go to school, they ran into the Cultural Revolution and went to school for several years.
Some have even ended their studies for as long as 15 to 17 years of age. They are forced to give up their studies, respond to the party's call, go to the countryside, and support the border areas.
After their work, they are of the view that the working class is the most glorious and voluntary choice of the most dirty work.
After a period of glory, I spent my entire life.
When they got married, they only gave birth to a child and started getting married.
Their salary is that they do not have a diploma, because they do not have a diploma.
They have worked hard to raise their children and provide them with basic education. When children get into university, they catch up with the reform of the education system, the double snow cream of the reform of state-owned enterprises, the tuition fee increases, and they are laid off.
As they grow older every day, they start to be sick, and unfortunately catch up with the reform of the medical system. As a result, they are unable to receive medical treatment because they cannot afford the medical expenses.
It can be seen that the injustice of society as a whole has been mercilessly lowered to this generation of people.
However, of these people, few were against Mao Zedong and attacked Mao Zedong.
Why?
They are not Mao Zedong's slaves. They have blood and flesh. They really live in the history of human relations in our society. They look squarely at the social phenomena of two times from their own experience of going to the countryside to get unemployed.
Although they have a lot of dissatisfaction and even hatred toward the abandoned studies of the Mao Zedong era, their lack of warmth and some poor social phenomena, they still think that Mao Zedong was good at the age of Mao Zedong.
Some net friends' parents are this generation. You can chat with them.

"injected watermelons" "cancer bananas" and "carton boxes"
From 2007-07 to 19: 02: 02: 57 p.m. [SMS] [tables] I remember there was a news report in the year before that the watermelons in Hainan were injecting chemical drugs into them. As a result, a large number of watermelons fell on the ground in Hainan, causing a large number of melon farmers to lose money.
This was followed by a follow-up report by CCTV, which confirmed that there was no such incident at all.
At the beginning of the report, this report was very bizarre because it would be impossible, in terms of workload, to treat a large watermelons with syringes without any practical significance.
The memory of last year was even clearer. Some media reports said that banana trees in Hainan are suffering from a disease similar to that of human cancer. The sick banana trees are inevitable to die.
As a result, many people have misunderstood that they have to suffer from cancer. As a result, it is still the same.
The reason why these two reports have created a sensation is that it directly touches upon the most sensitive part of the people's nerves, that is, the issue of food safety.
If the media say that a certain food product will be hazardous to health, then it will definitely be the same for the people involved. For one person, it will be impossible to eat a few Hainan watermelons and bananas. But for the production and sellers of these products, the impact will be too great.
Not long ago, Beijing came out with a strong estimate of food safety, that is, because of the price increase of pork, some people actually used cardboard boxes to produce steamed buns. This was a carton box.
After hearing this, I was also deeply shocked. I felt that the traffickers were too able to study the matter. They were able to think of such a method. They then spread the news widely and warned their families and friends to take to the streets again.
However, it was suddenly again reported yesterday that the story of the cartons was a false news. The whole matter was invented by a person. Thus, at the same time, he wondered what the media would be like today.
The fact that I have learned from a reliable channel is that a temporary staff member of the "transparency" section of the Beijing Television channel has taken away from the market the noodles, flour, and carton boxes that he bought from the market.
(6) the process of production was filmed by a domestic DvP with its own home, followed by its editor, and was broadcast by deception.
The public security organs have carried out criminal detention of suspects in accordance with the law and will be dealt with in strict accordance with the law.
After the handbag incident occurred, the government quickly organized relevant departments to carry out investigations, and launched a comprehensive and thorough inspection of the breakfast market in Beijing to ensure the safety of the people's dining table.
After the incident was confirmed, Beijing Television has openly apologized to the public, deeply learned the lessons, seriously investigated and prosecuted relevant personnel, and would further strengthen management, plug the loopholes, and resolutely eliminate false news reports.
It's just that even though the cardboard box is completely lost, it is still unknown when people can rest assured that they will go to the small stalls to buy them.
This incident also reflects, to a certain degree, the importance the government attaches to the issue of food safety and the speed of its action. It also illustrates to a certain extent that the dining table of the ordinary people in Beijing is still quite safe.
Who should be held responsible for education?
Recently, I have heard from friends in China about the experience of a school.
The incident occurred in a private secondary school in Shanghai, a private secondary school.
The school has decided to arrange for the best teachers to be offered to three classes from junior high schools to senior secondary schools, and a few young teachers who have no higher education experience and who have not been able to do so in the past.
The reason was that the student who signed the contract had agreed to give up the examination of other senior secondary schools, so the school had to ensure that the best teacher would be given to them in accordance with the agreement.
In regard to the students of other classes, the attitude of the school was: to give young teachers an opportunity to exercise training.
This does not help me. Who is going to be responsible for education?
I remember that when I went to a key senior high school many years ago, all the students in the class were dissatisfied with the teaching standard of a math teacher. No matter how many people signed a collective petition, they asked the school to change their teachers.
The school really changed the teacher to us, because the school's commitment to US was to treat every student equally, and he was responsible to every student.
Ten years ago, he came to the United States for graduate studies.
One summer in the summer, when the course was selected for the next semester, it was found that all the optional courses in the department were theoretical in nature, and some of the applied courses were not arranged at all.
I rushed to the department head and told him that I thought there was a problem with the curriculum.
The department head admitted that the applied courses were not provided because of a shortage of teachers. They had to wait for one or two years before they had a teacher.
I remember that at that time, he said to him, "this is your problem, not mine.
I traveled a long way from Shanghai to your hometown to study. It was because you were attracted by your curriculum agencies.
If you do not have the ability to set up these courses, you should not put them in the introduction. Otherwise, this is a false advertisement, which is irresponsible to me and to my family. "
After listening to what I have said, the head of the department would like to say: then I will see how we can solve the problem.
It may be too late because all the courses have been arranged to be registered online.
After three weeks, the department head talked to me to the effect that his job was to tell me that he was responsible for every student, including me.
He listened to my suggestion and tried his best to add two more applied optional courses. I hope I can understand it.
After this incident occurred, I repaired several courses at the head of the department.
He had never been biased against me because I had made comments to him, and each class had been fair to me.
On the eve of his graduation, I heard his secretary say that he had done his best for every student, but not every student was grateful to him.
At the graduation ceremony, as an honorary student representative, I told the chairman: Each of us is grateful to him for everything he has done for us, because he has done his utmost to be accountable to each and every one of us.
I feel that I have made the correct choice of life to go to school here.
At this point, I can see that in the eyes of the department head, there is a hidden tears. If one day, every Chinese educational worker and the entire education system can be held responsible for every student, I think the days of China's real leap forward will not be far away.

Last Sunday we took part in a four-person volleyball tournament for men in central New York. After six and a half hours, our team finally won the championship.
The competition was in fact a training course organized to prepare for the volleyball competition of the New York State Summer Games.
The coach took four men and a team of four men in the central part of New York to join the team, and each team was composed of four men and a group of four men.
The rules of the game are very interesting. They can only be attacked in the back. They can't be lifted to a three-meter line. They can only send a single person to stop the network, not to change one's place.
So basically the test is to test the strength of the attack and the defense of the defense.
Our team has a 2-meter reception. The attack is both strong and high. More than 60% of the attacks and scores have been arranged by him.
One meter 90 percent of the attack was caused by a lot of mistakes in the back row.
In addition, it's the main target of 1 meter 75, and when it comes to a surprise attack, the success rate is better than the other.
There were a total of seven teams.
However, after they lost, people's mentality was calm. In addition, they had achieved stability in these three fields, and thus began to win.
At the end of the cycle, my team scored three to three, and was ranked sixth.
Then I started the additional competition. In addition to the first team, two to seven team members were caught in the elimination competition.
It was my team's psychological and tactical stability, that is, to make a strong fight and take the lead to enter the semi-finals.
In the semi-finals, the competitors are weak. They beat my arms and my arms together. However, once we take a look at it, the joy is twice as much as that of a ball.
And I did not know how much the final score would have been.
In the final, the opponents broke the balance, and our side launched a lot of attacks and took the lead all the way.
At the end of the last 21: 24 hours, our side was holding a match, and the other side gave me two balls and asked me to fly. 23: 24, my team should come to me and tell me, "no problem, it's just two ball."
The next ball is coming back to me, and it is good for me to get it right. The two are passed on from the back to the next, and the fighting will be resolved once and for all.
Let's talk about morality.
In the case of individuals with scattered freedoms, much has been said about morality.
I have nothing to say in this respect.
Now I would like to talk about the collective.
We often encounter situations where there is a need for collective action.
On these occasions, some morality is needed for a group of people.
We can often find some good morality in those groups that have been successful.
This is not by chance.
For as far as these causes or activities are concerned, it is necessary to overcome some of the immediate difficulties, unite together and exclude those based on belief. I feel that the good morality has also played a role that cannot be ignored.
At the very least, it is very difficult for a group of people with very low moral standards to succeed in making a success.
It may be because, through a rational and long-term view, the wisdom of long-term interests can be seen as a need for collective success.
In fact, collectively, people often gain identity in various ways, such as logo, talk, faith, etc., as well as morality.
Only in the morning of white land, in the night of white land, the path of life can be found everywhere.
[explore] How many times do you live until now?
My senior high school friends finally got a visa. At the end of August, I was able to set out for a graduate school in the west coast of the United States.
When a few classmates gathered together today, it was really happy for her. Finally, I had to pay for what I wanted.
Watching her so happy, I really admire her.
When I think about it, it was only because I was admitted to senior high school that I was so happy. I never thought that I would be among the most prestigious schools in the city at that time. After that, I was not so happy when I became a university student.
Getting into university was not the one that I hoped for before. That was why I could not say so much.
When I was in university, the only sustenance was that he could go to the north after graduation and fell in love with me for two years.
How could that be done? a month before I graduated, he proposed to break up, and all the illusions that I had before had gone up in smoke.
Later, he went back to work in the north. Up to now, he has been working for two years and earned a medium car, but I have never been so happy.
I was chatting with good friends today. I could well understand her happiness. He was prepared to go abroad for a year and finally went abroad to start a new life. The feeling that his dream came true was really happy.
I do not have any plans to continue studying. I do not like life abroad because I've been working abroad for half a year ago. I find that life abroad is not suitable for me.
Seeing the happiness of good friends, I don't want to think about it. What am I going to pursue?
What can make me so happy?
Perhaps it was to find someone who really liked me and was willing to finish at the second half of my life.
I thought at that time, I would cry with excitement. Just as my friend told me, when she was interviewed by the embassy and received customs clearance, she could not help crying. For a year, she was worried, and finally had a return.
And me?
On the emotional side, one time and again in fear, I was able to do business, and when I was able to pay for it, I was so happy that I was so happy that I could go back to my heart.
Perhaps there is no future. I'm not worried about my career. I just want to be emotional.
When will my feelings end up?
On this issue, I feel very sad.
Ladies and gentlemen, how about you?
How many times have we lived until now?
Publicity campaign to promote the construction of the University of East China
Oh, he also gave a briefing on the construction of the institute.
The latest first-hand information adds to my feelings, such as a fake package.
President Wang, Secretary Li from the personnel section and several other teachers from the building technology Science and Research Department attended the report. I talked for an hour and then everyone talked for about one and a half hours.
At the end of the official report, teacher Zhang (the president's assistant) took me to the side, and asked me to talk about it at the door of my office.
He was very cordial and friendly. He told me in a formal meeting that he could not say anything at the formal meeting. He said that there was no end to my income for the future, so he told me about the specific situation of the teachers' income.
Prior to the report, Premier Wang gave an overview of the Construction Institute, saying that there were only six key disciplines in the national construction industry. There were two universities in east China, two at Tsinghua, two at Tsinghua, and the largest one, and there was no more than the other.
He said that the state has paid special attention in recent years to building energy efficiency, green construction, and building technology science. Tokyo would like to introduce a teacher in this area.
He said that they had received more than 20 applications for curriculum vitae, including those from China, Japan, and the United States.
The academy has attached great importance to this and has carried out serious inspections of these candidates.
Compared to the construction institutes of other colleges and universities that I know, Tokyo is indeed a leader, and Tongji city planning should be higher than that of Tokyo. However, from the direction of building design, it seems to me that it can be a little more than that. (I have never thought of it before.)
President Wang said that in the past two years, the research resources of the Institute of construction have been very abundant, and they belong to the colleges of the nation's 985 projects.
He told me that last year, there was a one-time allocation of 10 million construction funds for east China construction. Of these, 3.5 million were directly used to buy books to enrich the Construction Institute's professional library. (Oh, I have to praise this, it's quite impressive!)
Almost all of the remaining equipment was used to purchase experimental equipment in my professional direction.
It is said that several academicians have expressed their opinions.
Ha Ha ~ -- by the way, I feel that some of the imported equipment seems to have been slaughtered.
In the United States, there is an experimental system for measuring the air in the room, which is very common in the United States. It is estimated that US $500 will definitely be won. In the end, it cost more than 50,000 RMB!!!
In other cases, many of the houses have moved to the new campus of the 9 lung Lake. However, the Construction Institute is determined to maintain a good construction atmosphere, and there are some classic buildings in the old campus.
Oh, it seems that because other departments have moved away, the Construction Institute has to build another building.
Therefore, President Wang opened the door to tell me that he could be given a separate office in the future.
I was very embarrassed. When President Wang said this, I had no feeling about it.
Later, teacher Zhang brought me to the side and told me that it was not easy, because the office space was very tight, and some old professors did not have separate offices.
I am very uneasy about this. It seems that I still don't know too much about the national situation.
All in all, I have been very happy at this Tokyo trip. The leaders of the Academy of architecture and the relevant teachers have shown great professionalism and enthusiasm, which has left me with a very good impression.
I wish the Academy a smooth development, and the Construction Institute will continue to take the lead!
The Qin Huai River in the light of the light
The rest of the world is open to the rest of the world.
Two weeks ago, I had a meal with my colleagues, sending off the previous boss.
The boss is extremely good to us, and we are willing to work for her, or even to work overtime at night and on weekends. She is also the best boss of my job.
Because they have to take care of their families and have more time to educate their children, she left the company and opened a math class for primary and secondary school students.
I believe that she can succeed in whatever she does!
Sun Yanhua leaves Africa to take care of stones and stones hit by stones (photo set)
Care for sick children.
"mouse muscles".
After the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sun Yanzheng twice followed the world outlook to the Niger in Africa.
At a press conference yesterday, she admitted that she was the most tired journey in history.
In the heat of the local weather, the turbidity of drinking water and the visit to the market, people lost their stones in anger, and even camels were injured by camels.
"I want to go home," she says, "I want to go home!"
Children Suffer from Malnutrition
For the third consecutive year, he took part in the event to show concern for poor children. Sun Yancheng claimed to be a senior spokesman.
She shared 30 bottles of vitamin A, 40 flashlights and 500 candies with local children.
She says that since many experiences have been accumulated, no matter how many small gifts there are,
The most serious problem in Niger is that mothers are completely unaware of the problem of care and the problem of children suffering from severe malnutrition.
After a trip from the capital of the Niger to a small town of Tawa, 500 kilometers away from the capital of the Niger, Sun Yanhua experienced a rare sandstorm in the area.
The wind swept through the wind and brought rain into the sky. The entire sky was color changing.
The jeeps aboard were shaking with the wind.
Looking back at that time, Sun Yan was still scared to reveal that although he was in the car, he was very scared.
Later, he listened to the local people's explanation that the sandstorm was the symbol of good luck, and that she was slightly relieved when it brought rain to the land.
With the local population.
Sadly, my mother raised the problem.
When he arrived at Tawa, local officials held a single-peak camel welcoming ceremony. She asked Sun Yan to sit on the camel to accept the locals' cheering.
However, the camel was scared by a flashing light, and was not controlled at all. He almost fell to the ground and fell to the ground.
In the end, Sun Yansheng jumped down on his own, but was not careful enough to use his clothes to break his clothes, put his back on his back, and left about 8 centimeters long.
During his visit, Sun Yanhua visited four local children with severe malnutrition. Among them, four months old, with a weight of only 2.1 kilograms, was completely different from an individual.
She said: "Seeing him very sad, his situation is really too exaggerated. However, it should also be the mother's question. He should teach them the correct concept of nutrition."
The key to China's education
Keyword: the key to China's education - humanitarian to China's education - humanitarian
The aim of education is to make it easier for the educated to survive and enjoy in a given social environment.
"survival" is well understood by everyone, and the "enjoyment" may only be understood as "fun." In fact, this is not the case. The scope of "enjoyment" here is very wide.
Survival - including physical strength and enhancement of brain power
1. Strengthening physical strength, increasing coordination through all kinds of sports, increasing the level of coordination, and improving the ability of sports to meet the needs of physical operation and the need to deal with society.
2. The strengthening of brain power enables us to have a clearer understanding of the society in which they live, to learn about themselves, to learn to deal with others, and to learn to adapt to the skills of survival and enjoyment.
As discussed above, the purpose of education is not very much related to this article. Now we are talking about the key: the key to education in China.
The essence of human nature is that it is necessary to fully understand the differences of individual individuals and cannot be equated with each other.
Club original: several common stages of learning Buffett
Club original: several common stages of learning Buffett: I am for a walk.
1) during the first stage, if he had the feeling of being a treasure to the treasure, he immediately applied it to practice. However, at this time, he did not have a deep understanding of Mr. Buffett's understanding. He would often use a lot of mistakes and use it indiscriminately. Therefore, he did not have any results at all.
2) Phase II: "breaking through" Buffett. After a period of study and practice, almost every "wise man" is considering a number of issues: for example, what should Mr. Buffett with Chinese characteristics look like?
Does Buffett's theory need to be used flexibly in China?
Can you do better than Buffett?
So at this stage, it mainly focuses on being arrogant and blind, and looking for Buffett theory with Chinese characteristics.
After a period of practice, the effects often come from time to time and there is no continuity. If we are lucky enough, it is best to have some losses and turn back at an early date.
3) Phase III: go back to Buffett. After several attempts, he finally realized that he was an ordinary person, not a genius.
It should be a bit lower for oneself, and it would be quite enough to be honest and learn Buffett.
The simplest and most effective is the most effective, but simple methods often contain profound reasons, and it is necessary to understand them before they can be better put to the end.
The performance at this stage is limited in the short term, with many long-term effects and continuity.
4) phase four: "stubborn" Buffett, after enjoying sustainable results, this stage has basically been stubborn toward Buffett's theory. As for non-buffett companies, he completely ignores his attitude.
Continuously learning to deepen the understanding of Buffett and in practice, the performance of this phase is to achieve better results and continuity, and to enter a virtuous circle.
The time required for each person at each stage is not necessarily the same as that of the individual and the luck.
Bent toward Buddha (236,553903) 14: 05
He was an old friend of mine who sent such a story in the community.
I would rather write this story in this column.
I hope that we can all see this article and do not expect it to become the so-called essence, but there are some things, some of which can often be understood in a short and simple story.
This is a story that makes people feel very cold after watching.
I really hope that this is just a story......
On the mountain road, three armed men and men were staring at the beautiful female driver, forcing the CMB to stop and take the driver out of the bus. The driver was anxious for help, and the driver of the car kept quiet.
Only in the middle of the year, a thin and weak man rose to the ground, but he was injured.
The man was so angry that he wanted the whole car to stop the violence, but there was no response to the fact that the female driver had been dragged into the forest.
After half a period of time, the trio and the female driver, who was not full of clothes, returned.
The driver of the car was also forced to get out of the car with a thin and weak man who had been injured.
The man refused to hold up.
Hello, you get out of the car. My car does not hold you!
The middle-aged man was impatient and said, "why don't you tell the truth? I want to save you?"
You saved me?
What did you save me?
The woman driver denied that he was driven by a few passengers.
The middle-aged men are extremely angry and hate their own people!
If the rescue was not saved, the result would not have been the result of such expulsion. He was determined not to do so.
Moreover, I bought a ticket. I have the right to go by car!
The driver calmly said: "If you don't get out of the car, I won't drive."
What I didn't expect was that a man who had just turned a blind eye to the atrocities, just as he just woke up, urged the man to get out of the car.
A few powerful passengers even wanted to drag the middle-aged man out of the car.
The three robbers smile with a smile.
One of them, with a black skin, says with no sense of shame: the man is playing with her!
The other two robbers also spoke nonsense: She is my target, and she is locked up in your business!
After a quarrel, the man's luggage was thrown out of the window and he was subsequently pushed down.
The car also proceeded smoothly on the mountain path. The female driver snatched away his hair and sounded a tape recorder.
When the car arrived at the peak, he had to go down to the mountain. The left side of the car was on the road to the mountain, and on the right side was a cliff.
The car was quietly speeding up. The driver's face was very calm, with his hands holding the steering wheel on his hands, and his eyes were filled with tears in his eyes.
A burglar seems to be aware of what has happened, saying: slow and slow, what do you want to do with the TMD?
The driver did not say anything, and the speed was getting faster and faster.
The burglar attempted to rush over the steering wheel, but the car rushed toward the cliff like a departing Arrow......
The next day, local newspapers reported that a tragic disaster occurred yesterday in the Fu Hu mountain area.
The driver of the bus and the 13 passengers did not have a lifetime.
A middle-aged man, who had been driven out of the car in the middle of the road, saw the newspaper crying.
Nobody knew what he cried and why he cried.
The darkness of train stations
Recently, I went out for a few days and took a train to find out what was going on at the train stations in various places.
I'd like to know what attention the railway stations have to pay attention to.
I am Changsha. First, let's talk about the situation in Changsha. Everyone at the Changsha station must pay attention to it!
1. Train tickets that are always hard to buy: at the Changsha Railway Station, whenever there is a big vacation or winter vacation, there is no way to buy a ticket. There is no way to buy a ticket.
The best answer I asked was that the travel agency had decided to leave all the votes!
However, with regard to scalpers, how much more money will be added?
2. Beware of fake tickets: the votes taken by scalpers may not necessarily be true. Hunan's double peak and new form have become rich by false evidence. One relies on fake silver coins and fake coins to make a fortune. Therefore, fake tickets are really a pediatrium!
They are at the lowest level. Some fake tickets are called "real."
3. Who Moved My Note: We should be careful when buying things at the store of the train station.
If you want to give a zero note, Ha ha, your bank notes will always be out of the corner, so you have no choice but to change it.
However, after you change the big note, the owner of the shop has to say that he can't find any money, and then you still have to get a small amount of money out of the corner. At this time, you have to take back a counterfeit note!
4. A magician can find zero: not all the shop owners have to change your big note. That is a crime, and the risk is greater!
As a result, some "timid" shop owners have no choice but to act as a magician. It is clear to you that he is right to look for a few of them. But when you have the chance, you have a few more.
5. Wine everywhere: there are not too many tea seats at the train station, but you will find out when you go in.
A few glasses of red wine can sell the price of horse profits. If you don't, maybe your mother will recognize you.
6. Roses and guns: there are many video shows in the vicinity of the train station. The title of the program is still very attractive to US custom men. So, if you go in and watch the honorable guests, you will soon be able to get a silver bullet in a five-star hotel, or else the big knife will never be cut back to the ghost!
7. Ice and fire: if you speak Cheung Sha's accent or are very familiar with Changsha, then you will never want to hit a taxi in front of a station. The face of a taxi driver can let you know what you mean in June.
However, if you come to Changsha for the first time, congratulations, even if you are only five minutes away, the driver will give you a warm look at the scenic spots at the national level.
Of course, you have to make your own fare.
Nanjing subway drivers urged to undergo psychological testing as soon as possible
Keyword: psychological testing
According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency, on the night of July 3, a fatal incident occurred inside the Nanjing subway.
According to a reporter's description, "Chu cheng-ting, 22 years old, is a young subway driver. When the reporter met him yesterday, he seemed to have not come back from fear and sat on a chair.
Obviously, this young driver's spirit has suffered a great deal, and there is an urgent need to carry out psychological testing. Otherwise, it will lead to life.
I wonder if members will remember that, more than 10 years ago, the rescue personnel who saved a little girl from an abandoned oil well in Texas, United States, finally chose to commit suicide after a long period of mental torture.
At that time, although he had a simple psychological fine tuning, because people put more attention on the young girls who were rescued, they simply ignored those who were more in need of psychological testing, and eventually could not prevent the occurrence of the tragedy.
Similarly, in the last few years, the first British police officer, who opened the container, was said to have been scared to death.
The British side later carried out more than two months of psychological tuning in order to get him back to normal.
When people are subjected to disastrous incentives, they will suffer a great deal. At this time, it is very difficult for the individual to be completely restored, and the regular sessions are left with psychological scars.
Since it was difficult for outsiders to find out and found that there was no way out, many of the parties would suffer a lifetime.
However, it is not enough in our country to care for psychological trauma, especially in the case of the family of the client or the competent authority, often after losing the best period of recovery, when it is too late.
Now, with the diversification of the media, we have often heard of appalling incidents in which many female adolescents have been harmed and many young children have witnessed the cruel harm suffered by their parents.
After these young people were saved, they seldom heard that they had received psychological treatment, and most of them were comforted by their relatives.
In spite of the fact that the victims can feel that they are safe, their injuries have become a scars that can never be cured, and they will always be wake up and affect the lives of their clients.
Fortunately, the driver of the driver was able to persuade him in a timely manner, and he was able to ease his mental stress.
After all, the responsibility for the accident does not lie with the driver, and the driver has also taken measures to find out the situation. He has done what he has done, but it has not stopped the tragedy.
It is believed that even if the driver is not the driver, any person present will be shocked by the accident at the scene.
However, other people do not have the responsibility to be implicated in the killing. Although they are scared, they can gradually be forgotten with the passage of time.
The driver is not so lucky. He must remember that he is likely to remember a lifetime.
If he can get out of this relief and even if he does, he will often be tortured by this kind of scare.
The concept of modern health is much more comprehensive than in the past, and mental health has begun to be the focus of people's attention.
It is regrettable that the human spirit is very discouraging, especially in cities where the mental health of people is far from ideal, and most people have more or less mental problems, while others have failed to pay sufficient attention to problems.
Thinking about the lesson of the "Yang li-juan incident" at the previous stage, some irresponsible media have treated a patient suffering from mental problems as an object of speculation, resulting in a very bad social impact.
We should prevent such incidents from happening in the future. Otherwise, our society will become a sick society.
After training for the first phase of the first phase of the five and five teachers, there is a lot of emotion after training in the first phase of the new curriculum.
The first phase of the first phase of the new curriculum, the first phase of the new curriculum, and the first batch of five teachers in the first phase of the new course, the first batch of teachers who took part in the new course have truly felt the pressure and motivation of the new curriculum.
At the same time, they also believe that the new curriculum reform is a rare opportunity and challenge for the educational development of schools.
On the morning of the 13th, as a result of traffic jams on the road between Shek Jiang and longan road, several teachers and teachers from Tung Chung and other places arrived at the city bureau of education at about 1: 00 in the afternoon. The staff of the Bureau of Education, who had passed away from work for a long time, will still get out of the train and have received training materials.
At 2: 30 in the afternoon, the teachers went to the city of the city, the city of the city, and the six medium and middle schools in the city to listen to the experts' lectures.
Teachers or teachers who have taken part in the new curriculum reform are also briefed on the experience of teachers or teachers who have taken part in the new curriculum reform in the next two days.
On the morning of the 15th, after listening to all the training courses, they carried out another study. Five of the five teachers in the fifth grade had obtained a certificate of completion as a result of serious study.
During the training period, the teachers of the five middle school teachers exchanged views among themselves. At first, they had to feel that the new curriculum was relatively strange, the tasks were heavy, and the pressure was not good enough.
But after the training, everyone felt that it was an opportunity and a challenge.
They are determined to make efforts to adjust the knowledge structure and to successfully complete the task of curriculum reform as far as possible.
The second batch of teachers who took part in the new course had arrived at the relevant locations on the 16th to receive training.

Music and a friend with Star fans
Keyword: Star fans
I have a female friend that has never been seen before.
I tell her directly, I appreciate you very much!
Because you express your love directly.
She liked to be a male sponsor of a red entertainment program in Taiwan, and she never covered up with this kind of feeling.
This man presided over a program in Jinan. She flew to Jinan; the man presided over Changsha, and she flew to Changsha.
The man presided over a book saying that a friend gave him a bullet that did not have a bullet. She was pleasantly surprised to tell me, "the bow was sent by me."
She also participated in being a star electronic magazine, and she told me excitedly each time.
I had always liked to interact with someone who frankly admitted that he was a fan of the stars.
These stars can be movie stars. They can be stars, and of course they can be great men.
I have never felt that these friends are superficial. I feel they are very cute.
These people are usually real people who like it. They like it. If they don't like it, they don't like it.
It would be easy to come into contact with such people.
Although they will not take 100% of your feelings into account, you are at least aware of their joy and anger. They also know that they will have a greater sense of security when they come into contact with them.
These people are also very frank.
It is also necessary to have the courage to know how to express one's own likes.
It is precisely because of this that many people only quietly like a person for a lifetime, or he may even look down on those who openly say who are the fans.
Frankly, I believe that a person's greatest advantage is to be frank and honest to his friends.
But it is in fact very difficult to do so.
If you like a star, you can also prove that he has a selfless element in his heart.
Some of my friends were fans of some stars.
Sometimes, in order to see this star, he can have a rough time and be able to sacrifice a lot of money. He can use a paper card with his left hand, and his right hand is still shouting in his mouth.
It can be said that they are very foolish and naive, but they need to be selfless in being able to love a person without paying any return.
This is due to the fact that in reality, there are too many people who do not pay much attention to their own love for themselves and those who do not care about others. Therefore, it seems to be a bit precious.
So, when people talk about it, they say who are the stars that they like, and if there is a saying, I never worship others.
Ha ha, you had to be careful.
Chang chin-ju / tr. by Robert Taylor)
Keyword: cap.
By chance, we can see that there is a period of "Kangxi" which has not been seen for a long time, and the main character is the main character.
When I think about it, it is time to publicize the "color."
Looking at the "Taoyuan" period, I was obsessed with the days when I was obsessed with love.
At that time I felt very strange. It was really interesting to have pornographic films that were so beautiful, and sometimes it was very interesting, it was called love films.
In fact, the picture is not many, but it also covers quite a number of countries.
Korea and Japan were the first to come into contact.
After that, he saw many Third World countries as well as some Latin American and European countries. Instead, they looked less at Hollywood and French films.
Among them, I was not willing to delete two of them, one was "youth," and the other was "pink."
The first half was quite good in the first half of the year, and everyone was a new actress.
The latter part is somewhat abnormal. I totally accept it.
What I really want to say is that chapter Xiao Hui said in the program that her boyfriend covers almost all the countries of the world, with the exception of Africa.
At present, she has four partners.
The problem is that most people are afraid that they cannot accept it. They will say that this person is not being detained.
However, the crux of the matter is that when she said these problems were very frank, there was nothing to make people feel uncomfortable.
She also spoke about her own love concept.
For example, the economies of the two sides should be independent.
I guess people should also be independent and take control of their own fate.
Because I know that love in love is both alive and selfish. How can people who love themselves be allowed to accept other people's love at the same time?
According to my experience and speculation, it is no longer a simple touching relationship. She is bound to be a typical older sister.
The older sister can accommodate everything, including a few younger brothers at the same time. At the same time, the younger brother can count on the older sister because of his charisma and motherhood. However, he may not mind whether it is the only, and so on.
But in the interview, I found that she was actually a person who knew very well how to enjoy life.
For example, she was keen to travel to a low level.
So I had reason to believe that her life was excellent.
I am afraid that I could not accept such a phenomenon before we get there.
For example, I have accepted a lot of people now. In fact, it does not have much to do with tolerance and intolerance. It is because as long as you think about it, there is no absolute love or no love.
These people, such as Passera, friend B, Zhang Ziyi, good friend ((PW)), and Fu Yung's sister.
Looking at other people's lives, is it not the main character for others to see their own lives and their own lives?
This is just like, although I am not in the game, I've always had my legend.
People, you always have a bit of entertainment.
Keyword: the spirit of entertainment
It is a very tiring thing for people to live. Therefore, I still have a bit of entertainment.
Let's talk about others, or look at the jokes of others, and talk about other people.
For example, there will be an easy and easy version of the "entertainment" version of the world.
All of you speak out freely. But of course you should be certain that they are not capable, because there are all kinds of "black spots."
"If you want to say it," the result is, you don't know what you are talking about, but you have to understand what you are looking at.
Little s refers to Tsai Kang as a "scholar."
If I also calculate it, then it belongs to that kind of reading. However, I still don't have any idea about it.
Well, I always have the foresight.
However, when I was reading this book, I had got some things that I wanted to get.
It happened that I liked to blindly think about it, so I thought about it while reading it. However, I also had a lot of reasons. A lot of things were bright and pleasant.
So, I gradually developed some habits, for example, to tell yourself, to be strict with yourself, to be better for others.
If they encounter problems, they should first find out the reasons for themselves.
- to deal with things in a more rational manner, and to deal with the feelings of friendship;
He has a low profile and has a low profile in his work.
However, as you know, people are not so good. They will always be selfish. They will always consider their own gains and losses, and they will always be in a mess when they are rational.
Fortunately, fortunately, I will not think of any regret in the choice of one's own choice.
After it was done, it was approved.
People want so much to be useless.
Fortunately, I am not that kind of person who likes the plate to improve his own personality. He is also a secular person.
What is different from some people is that it is not necessary to be angry at all, and to be more rational.
Or, for example, they have a particularly strong sense of belief.
Once we trust a person, everything I think is good.
Even if they are insufficient, they are willing to be tolerant.
Even though they are not like friends and friends, they are in the category of friends who put themselves in the position of friends.
But as a result, they are more strict with their friends.
I also don't understand why there are so many people who trust the words in the newspaper.
Or, in their minds, the current reports are the same as before.
But in this world, there are quite a lot of things that I don't understand.
Joke.
I gave myself a deaf ear to myself.
Song Dandan's "depth of happiness", warm and moving
Keyword: Song Dandan, deep happiness
In the previous period, a book was read in the newspaper by Song Dandan, which was called "the depth of happiness."
I just want to read it.
Because I think, as a woman of this age, having such a profession, having experienced changes in his family and career, how should she view himself and her life?
In the end, it was not disappointing. After reading it, there were two feelings. First, I was sent to see other people's lives. We could also see my own shadow. Second, I was very moved, and they were all details of family feelings.
Why was it sent?
In the book, Song Dandan wrote, "I have overlooked an important principle in life: to give more happiness than acceptance.
I'm always busy giving, busy making myself happy.
I don't know how to accept it. I have overlooked the fact that people are given the right to happiness. "
I found that I had always enjoyed such happiness, but maybe I should pay attention to some things in the future.
If a person can calmly face up to his own past and display all this in front of the public, it will require considerable courage.
This includes her first love, her marriage with Britain, as well as her depth autopsy, and her son's relationship with her son.
This book is also worthy of praise, because as a publishing house, I would probably have been strongly advocating her to focus on the "I love my home", the "House of Flying Daggers" and a series of skit cases with Zhao Benshan.
However, she must have insisted that Zhao Benshan only talked about it at the end. As for the "flying ambush" and "I love my home," she almost did not mention it.
This book is filled with a 40-year-old woman with a warm and emotional understanding of life, love, family, and family feelings.
Busy holidays
Keyword: busy holidays
The holiday was almost a week away, and he hadn't been idle.
He held a meeting at the college and also had to prepare for a meeting to be held next week, as well as a statement of the meeting.
This holiday will be very busy.
If there is no accident, according to the plan, three meetings will be held, four or five cities need to go.
All of a sudden, life was filled with many contents, similar to different categories, almost forgetting the previous holidays.
It seems that I've never been idle in my memory.
It's just that it has taken a very long time to dispose of it, and it seems that there has been less time this year.
Is it a good thing or a bad thing?
If they are busy, they will be better. However, if they do not produce any results without results, the significance of this will be reduced.
However, in some cases, life does not seem to be completely based on effects, and life is used in a gradual manner. It is also a kind of achievement, although it is sometimes impossible to measure in terms of social assessment criteria.
Everybody needs a sense of social value and self-worth. If the two are not able to do so, what are we going to do?
Marxism teaches us that we should focus on social values and advocate for individuals to contribute to society. However, in reality, a healthy and healthy society should fully respect the wishes and values of the individual and create conditions for the realization of personal values.
All of a sudden, thinking of these, it is becoming more and more evident that the Marxist principle is really very effective.
This is indeed the truth, but when it comes to real life, it is sometimes difficult for people to be confused.
Even if the realization of self-worth is not to the detriment of social values, each and every one of us in reality will be satisfied with genuine self-realization, and the social assessment will be ignored?
Or, are we able to get away from the social assessment of our self-worth?
It seemed very difficult.
That is why each and every one of us, while trying to do a good job in an ordinary ordinary person, is bound to go ahead and go beyond it.
This is probably the social aspect of people.
We had a holiday, but it was a bit easier.
At the very least, there will be time for a video disc, which can be relaxed for a while.
As the saying goes, the work still needs to be done.
Next week we will go to Xi'an to meet again.
Even though I have not been there, because some "prejudice" does not seem to be a very popular city.
I hope that this visit can change my impression of the city.
"A woman who has a right to live"
Keyword: Boys' rights era
In the afternoon, she gave me a call, chatted for a while and talked about "the voice of happy men."
She said, "Don't you think so? You are so cute. When you look at you, you're almost as good as men. You are simply a loyal viewer of Hunan TV."
That's what I said.
Ying said that he had seen some boys' TV talent show contests, and I felt that they were all women and men. However, I told her that a happy man had reached 5 to 4 in the next week. She was really good at a single top.
Ying Ying, who studied mass culture and consumer culture, also said with excitement: next week we will also look at it. After all, at the most critical stage of the competition, we must look at them, pay attention to these, and accumulate some case resources for future research.
Then we talked about it, it was an era of men's color.
Men finally turned from "watching" to "watching." In the past, women who used to be the objects were turned into subjects and could be viewed from the perspective of observers and faced with all types of male taxis.
Ying said that this is the liberation of women, and it is a sign of feminist theory.
She then went on to say: "Don't you feel that you are women right now?"
After listening to Ying Ying, I burst into laughter.
This is, in itself, full of feminist meaning. It is only that I do not have such a good idea of thinking so that these things can be made more profound and understood.
Like a happy male voice, Chen Chu's song has a very special sense of quality. It is very pure and pleasant to have the power to penetrate the time and space in people's minds.
They have a wide variety of songs and warm feelings, but they feel relaxed and lively, but their feelings are relaxed and lively.
The songs of Zhang Jie are very strong, and in particular, the two songs of PK today, "You look like you" and "Past events" are all my favorite songs, and they are deeply impressed.
Wei Chen's lovely and pure face is said to be very good for girls, and his voice is of course quite good.
These four strong disputes should be very interesting.
Look forward to their spectacular performance next week!

6.29 there is an international roaming in the mess. However, when the plane is cut off, cell phone is no longer a signal. Perhaps the scope of the global link is within the limits of its heart, and it will take effect from the next charge day.
These days, I will lose contact with you for a short time. Ha ha, some people will worry about me because of this.
With the opening of the Secretary station, he only wanted to prove who was thinking about me.
Whether it is public or private.
However, the problem is that I am in the hope of whose yearning?
Heart, I don't know when it will start, but it has become blank.
I do not understand why there are always people who do not want to stay, but some people do not want to stay, but they always think that they can squeeze in. It seems to be talking about shopping malls.
However, whether you have any position or not, can you let the "white gloves" be squeezed?
After all, material and heart cannot be considered on the same day.
Our car is moving toward the high-speed of Busan.
The minister did not say a word and there was nothing I could do.
After all, he does not understand Chinese and does not understand English. I can only say a few words in English.
There is a lot of silly looking at the computer and striking the keyboard. Except for the keypad sound, that is, the happy GPRS navigation sound of the Miss South Korea, everything is too quiet.
Outside the window, only the endless green and grey days can be seen.
Silence is not like my personality.
The only thing that could not be expected was that this country was the only one that left me with a sense of intimacy.
In addition to the effects of radioactive dizziness on me, there are no other functions in the circle.
I think that South Korea will definitely not go to produce round rules.
This is because there is no need for the market.
Seoul is very clean, completely clean and meticulously clean.
However, it is a pity that in the few days of his stay, apart from the place of work and department stores, there is no time to go. All the impressions are limited to a wait-and-see approach along the road.
Fortunately, everything is good!
South Koreans have a very traditional courtesy, a piecemeal smile, careful listening, elegance, and quiet.
All we can pay attention to is the beautiful surface, the traditional customs, the ancient architecture, and the civilization of fear.
Is this hypocritical?
It is still a bit false. At least everyone is polite!
If you don't see the ugly things, you may think that there is no such thing.
The restaurant in South Korea is excellent!
It's just that I don't like it, and I don't understand why we are going back and forth.
As a result, the people of the Republic of Korea are still very serious about eating and eating. They can tell the difference between the time and the length of a kimchee, which is different from the surface of the ground or the ground floor.
This shows that the severity of South Koreans is probably related to the early arrival of kimchee.
It's just a headache. The Japanese bean curd Museum that the minister is going to take us will not be known, and how will it be combined with kimchee?
I remember the Chinese restaurant last night, there was a feeling of crying, completely Korean, and the only thing that could be imported was kimchee.
Ah, uh, thank you, China Southern Airlines, for its kimchee when providing plane meals.
The airlines must believe that I had to get used to it when I was on the plane.
In a couple of days, I have to return to China. If there is still no one to ask for it, I still want to ask the aunt to do some red-hot meat.
After all, the satisfaction of the stomach is more direct than your heart.
Of course, it has nothing to do with kimchee.
Two trees
Two trees, one is me, and the other is a brother-in-law.
We are competing with each other, and we care for each other.
I have many children. However, I have only my sister's sister, no brother and brother. Thus, the arrival of my older sister is extremely important.
We are all bitter children, and very little will have to participate in a lot of domestic work. Even though I have been trying to pretend to be a big man, I want to do the same thing as a man, but I have never got the consent of his father.
When I was a child, I was not too serious, but it was hard to avoid it.
For example, my father asked me to bring a bit of mud to the chimney of the old house, and I climbed onto the roof to operate the roof.
The chimney doesn't do well, but when it rains, the House is exposed to water. The reason is that I have broken the roof.
For example, my father asked me to change the bulbs, the old-styled White jump light.
When I climbed up to the chair, the bulbs in my hands fell into the concrete floor.
There are too many examples of this kind, so when the older sisters enter into the house, they are taken for granted by him, and they are extremely beautiful and do not have to pay any labor costs.
I would not be able to hide in a corner to see those bricks and bricks.
Later we became two trees and two big trees capable of supporting a family.
However, the father, on the other hand, was inevitably reduced, and in a wheelchair he became an obscure shrubs under the shade of the shade.
When the situation suddenly changed, the 50-year-old brother-in-law suddenly became seriously ill. On the face of it, it seemed like a large tree that could hardly find its way to death.
Outside the operating theatre of the Beijing Union and hospital, the doctor lightly said, "there is no value for the surgery."
You can still live for two months at the most.
At that moment, I seemed to have been hit by a bomb, and the soul came in an instant, just like a fool.
I began to dream again. I saw the old courtyard of the family, as well as the young sisters who were busy in the courtyard.
It was my sister's sharp cry that woke me up. I would rush to sit down and sit down and sit down in the hospital corridor, with all the tears in our tears.
All of a sudden, the bright sun suddenly disappeared, and it got dark in front of my eyes.
After returning from Beijing to our city, the brother-in-law quickly learned about his condition. After he and his sister burst out in tears, they were relieved.
My brother-in-law began an orderly arrangement. For example, he told her son: on behalf of your grandmother, she wants to be with your grandparents after she dies, and how should the grave be opened after her death.
I often go to visit your maternal grandfather, who will buy some practical items for him in the course of the year.
For example, he told my sister: after I left, you have to watch your elder sister often. She is certainly very lonely.
I took the time to visit him as much as I could, but when I was faced with me, he had a face in his face.
We often have nothing to say about it, just like two plants that, despite their lives, are unable to engage in dialogue.
These are two adult trees. The experience of the wind and rain has enabled us to face the tribulations calmly. What else do we need to explain to me?
There seemed to be no need.
Because you know that after you leave, the elder sister, the elder sister, and your children, and the people, you can only rely on my tree to support it alone.
Who asked me to be a man?
It's a man, regardless of whether you are willing or not, you have to stand up and take responsibility without hesitation.
The only thing that we regret is: Why did your tree die early? You should have a rich and graceful old age.
The day you walked was New Year's Day.
That is, when Chinese all over the world happily welcome the Spring Festival, you alone leave alone.
Perhaps, in another space of time, is another child born to life?
N minutes in life
The reason for such a seemingly fashionable title is that, at a time of extreme despair, the brain of confusion has no time to take care of time.
If an innocent person receives a death sentence in a vacuum, will he still be idle to pick up the grammatical errors in the judgment?
It was a winter when young people were very cold.
It was not known who was on duty. The stove did not fire the fire every day.
Because it was said that there was a strong earthquake, and when it came back in the evening, we were lazy.
On the long lead shop where 12 people were able to sleep, the four of us were wrapped in a quilt. Under the yellow light, they were playing "three blows" and winning a meal.
All of a sudden, a long and close voice came in. Some of us just looked at it in a moment and immediately became aware of the disaster.
As a result, they cast off the paper cards in their hands and went down to the field to go through two narrow doors.
In the moment when we were able to get out of the dormitory, it turned out to be an instant noodles.
Into the courtyard, we were as if we were standing on a boat that shook hands all the time. As if they had not fallen on their backs, they would not be able to fix themselves down.
In the last few seconds, all the buildings around us, with a stable image of the past, sent out a strange call, which was almost crazy, and then turned into a smoke of smoke.
The electric wires on the head were naturally unwilling to be lonely, and they ran all over and fled in the same way.
In front of us in front of us, the plague, which is rampant in the world, is being released for its own creativity. It is comparable to any major war in the United States.
At that time, there was only one thought: the End of mankind has come!
I can imagine that the land at the bottom of the earth is open to the bottom of the earth.
My spine was numb and numb to the ice, and the faces of some of my companions were uncertain as they were on paper.
I was thinking: will mankind say goodbye to this colorful world? Will the history of the civilization of tens of thousands of years disappear?
However, I am still not up to 20 years old. The flowers of youth have just been blossoming. The fast idea of survival has just been realized. How could I have a beautiful life like that?
My parents, my family members, wherever you are, what are you doing now? Are you still living in the world?
Faced with a smile on the face of death, how do I miss you!
...... I don't know how long it will be.
A giant ship that was caught in the rough sea was finally moving slowly into a peaceful harbor.
A young and broken heart has finally been carefully returned to its original position after going through almost crazy abuses.
The earth, my homeland, you finally let us feel the warmth and intimacy of the home!
A sense of happiness in the rest of the game, like a warm current, fell full of the whole body from the feet.
After being secured at the age of 17, after taking a firm stand, faced with a harmonious and warm youth center, today it is a piece of rubble that has broken down. All of a sudden, they burst out in tears.
All the people were infected with tears.
When the Sky begins to Snow, is it a mourning for the misfortune of mankind?
In that year, a total of thousands of lives were claimed by the earthquake in Hai Cheng.
Some experts said: Fortunately, the forecast was timely, and when people had not yet slept, the strong earthquake of "7.3" would have to take the lives of at least 100,000 people!
Just one year apart, the Tangshan earthquake hit, with over 200,000 people killed.
Those things in the village
There are many families in the village. Among them, a family in the south is the most demanding of the people. There is a famous saying in the village: fire prevention, crime prevention, and prevention of the South.
The South family is actually quite honest.
Some people would usually steal something from other people's places. Other families in the south would just steal a chicken and touch a dog, so that all the people in the village would be isolated from the south.
Nobody is clean. Who caused my family in the south?
The South family began to hold a number of very decent activities, indicating that the village was first established by the ancestors of the South, and that the South family has always been a major contributor to grain production, and has made significant contributions to the construction of the village.
At the same time, the family members of the South have closely asked village cadres to come to their homes to take a look and sit down.
All in all, the people of the South are very excited, and they have to take the initiative to fight a battle.
Not long ago, the West had done a very shameful thing and carried out brutal persecution of the seedlings of the South family.
The family of the West is known to be well-known for the entire village, and all the young men in the village have benefited from the western family.
If not for the good media carried out by the Western family, how can all the families be able to make good production?
But at this moment, the family members of the western family used a black brick to hit the seedlings of the South family. The whole village was extremely angry, and all the people in the village said that there were no good people in the West.
The reaction of the family members of the South to the family has aroused the sympathy of the entire village.
People all over the village turned to the family of the West.
As a result, the battlefield moved to the west.
The South family decided to create a good image before the 17th meeting of the village.
Even though the cadres in the village urged everyone to live together in harmony every day, there was always no peace in this named village.
The most unpleasant thing is that in a short period of two to three months, even pigs have started to engage in rebellion in order to raise their value.
In the past two years, do you think that all the chickens in the villages have been killed?
How can a pig do not have a long mind?
You have to quarrel with the revolution again, and you can't help but be killed!
Although the days of American and British villages that are accustomed to bullying people are rich, they are not necessarily peaceful.
There are so many drifters. Today, the tall buildings in the US village have been bumped off. Tomorrow they will throw some people into the subway in the English Village. It is also scary, isn't it?
As a result, people in the Central People's Republic of China generally feel that they cannot afford to live in the room, to see the disease, and not to read books. Although they are disgusted, they will be able to find some fields, work, and engage in relations, and they can also be regarded as entering a new era.
The families of the South and the West, Ah, who did not find it hard to read?
Let's take a look at the family of the Gulf in a little bend in the southeast of the village. Even though the parents of that family do not want to face the face, our great Chinese village will not just cover up this family.
It is expected that the 2008 village games will be held in our Chinese village. Those breaking things in the village will be provincial, and the bad kids in the village will be full.
Various households, electric light fire, rich money, Ah, have made a strong contribution.
At that time, everybody went to the village hall to see the golden eggs in the Bird's Nest!
Dear viewers, dear viewers, you are the host of a village TV station.
