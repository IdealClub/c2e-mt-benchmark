After the launch of the European Mars exploration boat hunting dog on the 2nd, there was no information about it.
(AFP report from London on the 1st) a spokesman for the Mars Exploration Program said that a US satellite could not be connected to the European little hunting dog No. 2 (Beagle 2) landing craft.
Barat said, "We have not yet achieved any results."
He said: "Now we are placing our hopes on its mother ship Mars Express, waiting for it to gather intelligence."
The United States has not been able to get any information from the European Mars detection dog on the 2nd, and the little hunting dog on the 2nd has continued to search for signs of life on Mars since it landed on Mars on the 2nd.
The Mars Odyssey spacecraft was launched into the Mars orbit by the US space administration to carry out another exploration mission.
The European Space Agency, based in Paris, said that the Mars Express satellite, made in Europe, has been launched to the extreme orbit of Mars, and it is hoped that it will continue to send back some signals next week.
The dog was originally scheduled to land on Mars on the 2nd, but its signal remains elusive.
It became the first European spaceship to land on another planet on December 19, after it left the mother ship Mars Express on December 19.
During the 18 days of flight, the little hunting dog planned to test the rock, soil, signal transmission mode of Mars, or all the current life on Mars.
Scientists have boldly predicted that this British spaceship may fall into a hole.
Pakistani President Musharraf wins vote of confidence in Senate and House of Representatives
(Agence France-Presse, Jan. 1) Pakistani President Musharraf won the confidence vote of both the Senate and the House of Representatives today, in the face of the abstaining of Muslim teachings and resistance from opposition parties. This confidence vote confirmed that Musharraf's rule will continue until 2007.
Minister of Information Rashid told the AFP reporter: "Musharraf won the majority vote of Congress.
No member voted against him. "
In the 342 seats of the House of Representatives, 191 members of the House of Representatives voted in support of Musharraf, and members of the Muslim community abstained. The opposition party boycotted this controversial vote of confidence.
Musharraf made concessions to the alliance of six Muslim political parties. He agreed to resign as commander-in-chief of the army and, at the same time, to seek the approval of the Supreme Court within one month.
In the 100 seats of the Senate, 56 senators voted in support of Musharraf, 42 Muslim religious members and opposition congressmen abstained or resisted.
Musharraf gained power in the October 1999 coup, and subsequently refused to step down.
President Jiang Zemin: the former resistance army will join the military leadership.
On a New Year's Day, he said that the joint meeting of chiefs of staff will be formed before next week, and members will include former resistance army leaders.
The former resistance army "Democratic Security army" welcomed this move and praised it as an "important step" towards the establishment of the new armed forces.
The new military leadership will be ready by January 5 and the new military leadership will be ready by January 7, four of which will become the leader of the former resistance army.
He said: "all parties to the signing (November 2003 ceasefire) agreement must be settled by 5 January at the latest," he said.
He added that the joint meeting of chiefs of staff, including former resistance army leaders, must be ready by January 7.
This operation is mainly related to the largest "Democratic defence force" of the six resistance organizations that have signed the peace agreement.
The seventh Resistance Army, the National Liberation Army, refused to sign the peace agreement.
Since the outbreak of civil war between the Hutu Resistance Army and the Tutsi government in 1993, it has resulted in the death of some 300,000 people.
China seizes 86 tons of US beef
(Agence France-Presse, Beijing, 2) - The Chinese state media "Beijing Youth Daily" reported today that since the market is worried about the risk of imported beef infected with mad cow disease, the relevant authorities launched a market identification operation for meat products. Yesterday, 86 tons of US beef were seized in Beijing.
The Beijing Youth Daily pointed out that according to the proposal of the Ministry of Agriculture, the beef will be destroyed after testing.
More than 30 countries in the world suspended imports of American beef last week, and China was also one of them.
All cattle related products, with the exception of milk and other dairy products, leather and photographs, are prohibited.
The Beijing Youth newspaper reported that the Beijing Agricultural Bureau recently issued a series of control and control laws and launched a comprehensive market inspection operation.
At present, no cases of mad cow disease have been reported in various parts of China.
The above-mentioned seizure of beef was the second in the past week. Prior to this, the relevant authorities seized 60 kilograms of beef from Washington, the United States, from a US cargo ship in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province.
Although statistics from the Ministry of Commerce show that last year China's imports from the United States amounted to 53.2 million US dollars, but the import volume of American beef is still unclear.
From January to July last year, China imported a total of US $310 million worth of meat from the United States.
North Korea authorizes US delegation to visit Yongbyon nuclear facility
(AFP, Washington, 2) today, the US newspaper reported today that the Pyongyang authorities have authorized a US delegation, including top nuclear scientists, to visit North Korean nuclear facilities next week.
Members of the delegation told the United States today that the Bush administration had approved the visit of the United States delegation to North Korea scheduled for January 6 to 10.
This will be the first visit by a foreign delegation to a nuclear facility in North Korea since the United Nations inspectors were expelled by North Korea a year ago.
The US delegation includes a Chinese expert from Stanford University, two foreign policy assistants from the Senate and a former State Department official responsible for dealing with the Pyongyang authorities.
During the period from 1985 to 1997, the nuclear expert of the mission, hekker, led the United States national laboratory for the United States, which had taken the lead in the development of the atomic bomb.
Prior to this, North Korea recently notified the US embassy in Beijing that Pyongyang authorities were preparing to attend the second round of six-party talks on the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula.
US officials said earlier this week that the Pyongyang authorities had indicated their readiness to participate in the six-party talks to be held at the beginning of the year.
At the end of the first round of six-party talks held in Beijing in August last year, no conclusion was reached. North Korea subsequently criticized the consultation as "useless."
The second round of the six-party talks was originally scheduled to be held in December of last year, but the talks were postponed until the beginning of this year due to differences of position on what measures must be taken to solve the problem.
The Washington authorities demanded that North Korea unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons program, while the Pyongyang authorities insisted on requiring the United States to provide legally binding security assurances as a means of exchanging conditions for it to abandon its nuclear weapons development program.
US government says it has nothing to do with the US delegation visiting North Korea.
(AFP, Washington, 2) The US government said today that it has nothing to do with the United States delegation, which is preparing to visit North Korea in preparation for a visit to North Korea.
On the occasion of China's efforts to urge the United States and North Korea, as well as Japan, Russia and South Korea to return to the negotiation table, a delegation of American scholars and scientists, as well as another US congressional assistant, intends to visit North Korea.
US State Department deputy spokesman Ereli said, "We have nothing to do with this group or group's plan to visit North Korea."
Ereli said, "I think we should have a clear understanding that these groups or individuals are not representing the government."
One of the delegations was led by a senior Chinese expert from Stanford University, as well as a nuclear scientist, head of the former losalas laboratory, and a member of the delegation included the US State Department's special envoy for negotiations with North Korea last year.
Today, the US newspaper reported today that the delegation would visit the Yongbyon nuclear power plant. However, a member of the delegation told AFP that the visit was still uncertain.
There is also a possibility that the visit will change after extensive media coverage, and it is still uncertain whether this delegation will be able to gain access to North Korea.
Another delegation was led by the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr Ruker, and the assistant director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden, who is the principal member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The United States is waiting for Israel to clarify the plan for the occupation of the Golan Heights.
(AFP, Washington, 2) The US government said today that Israel has not yet given a satisfactory answer to the US request for clarification of Israel's plan to expand Jewish settlements in the occupied Golan Heights.
The State Department said that Israel had already responded to the US request after the incident was reported on Wednesday (March 31).
However, Israel's reply could not fully remove the United States' doubts.
State Department deputy spokesman Ereli said, "We have already received an answer, but it is not a clear answer. We are still not sure about this situation."
He reiterated Washington's opposition to any new Israeli settlement activities.
Ereli said, "We have made it clear that we are opposed to the new development activities. We do not think it is useful.
According to media reports, Israel plans to set up nine new settlements in the Golan Heights occupied by Syria in 1967, and has increased the number of Jewish people from 10,500 to around 15,000 during the three-year period.
This occupation has been widely criticized by many Arab countries.

He is still preparing to expel a British writer who is suspected of insulting his president.
(Agence France-Presse, Shaka, 5) China's Minister of the Interior sikapwa said that he had ordered British writer Clark to leave the country within 24 hours on the grounds that Clark had "insulted" President Mwanawasa in a weekly column in the civilian newspaper Post (post).
Sikapwa told a group of demonstrators who had marched to the Ministry of the Interior requesting the expulsion of Clark, saying, "Clark will have to leave the country within 24 hours.
I would like to announce to the nation that we have taken action. "
However, Clark said in an interview with AFP that he had not received any notification.
"I am not aware of the fact that a deportation order has been issued," said Clark.
Meng Ba, permanent secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, pointed out earlier that he had proposed to the minister of the Interior to issue an order of expulsion.
He said: "When someone insults the president of a country, this is tantamount to insulting the people he represents. He should go back to write articles about his own people."
Clark has lived in the country for many years and married a person who is still a member of the women's rights movement.
Post editor mmengbe said that he was willing to take responsibility for the article that was published last Thursday and urged him to point the finger at him instead of Clark.
Foreign nationals who were suspected to have insulted the president or the head of the government have also been deported in the past.
Koizumi asserts that he will continue to promote economic reforms this year.
(AFP, Tokyo 5) at a press conference held on the first working day after the new year holidays, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said: "Although the economic situation remains difficult, we can finally see signs of recovery."
Koizumi stressed: "I will adhere to the reform policy and continue to promote reform.
The continuation of the reform efforts will lead to economic recovery. "
Koizumi said that he will focus on the deliberations of the National Assembly on the privatization of postal services this year.
"We will finally take action on the privatization of postal services, which is the main axis of economic reform," he said.
Koizumi added that he hoped to introduce the bill to Congress early next year.
Koizumi has promised that there will be a complete privatization of the postal service industry with 280,000 employees in 2007.
Japan's postal service industry is regarded as the largest bank in the world by virtue of its savings and insurance fund of 355 trillion yen (3 trillion US dollars).
However, this large-scale project still faces strong opposition from members of the conservative parliament.
This plan began when Koizumi was the Minister of postal services in 1993.
Analysts pointed out that the Japanese economy is expected to maintain a stable growth of about 2 percent this year, but the Japanese people may still be worried about further wage reductions and layoffs.
The unemployment rate in Japan remained above 5 per cent at a time when many companies continued to rectify the situation to ensure profitability.
US starts to take pictures and retain fingerprints for foreign visitors
(Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th) - Singapore, the location of the largest airport in Asia, supports the new measures taken by the United States today to take photographs of foreign visitors and retain fingerprints in response to the terrorist threat.
The Washington authorities have stepped up the examination of the timing of entry of foreign visitors. At a time when there has been a great increase in air flight safety concerns over the past week, the aforesaid worries have caused a number of flights to and from the United States to be suspended temporarily.
The new measures to photograph and retain fingerprints apply only to foreign visitors who need to obtain a visa to enter the United States, and it is generally expected that the number of such visitors will reach 23 million for the whole of this year.
The Homeland Security Department, which is responsible for the implementation of the US-VISIT Program, has pointed out that citizens of most of the 28 countries in Europe are exempted from the above procedure.
The immigrant group criticized the plan for violating the rights of citizens to freedom and a step towards the creation of a monitoring society, and homeland security secretary Ridge tried his best to defend the plan.
The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) said: "One of the primary responsibilities of any government is to ensure the security of the border.
By 2005, all immigration checkpoints, both land and air, will be ready to take photographs and retain fingerprint technology.
All United States visas and passports will eventually be included in the "biological identification logo", including photographs and fingerprints.
Prior to the implementation of the plan, the United States rose in December last year to guard against the threat of terrorist attacks in the United States.
The six-party talks between the United States and North Korea may be postponed to the middle of the year.
(AFP, Seoul, 6) South Korea said today that because of the strong attitude of North Korea and the United States, a new round of nuclear talks between the six countries may be postponed to the middle of the year.
"I hope that the talks will be held no later than the first half of this year," he said.
In Washington, while rejecting Pyongyang's latest request for major concessions in exchange for a nuclear freeze, and saying that the two sides still need to resolve their serious differences before the nuclear talks, Yin Yongkuan made the above remarks.
Yin Yongkuan said that the timing of the six participating countries actually ruled out the possibility of the reopening of the six-party talks in January.
However, he did not provide clues as to why the new round could be extended to June or later.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister rojuev attributed this to the tough attitude of the United States and North Korea.
He had participated in the first round of six-party talks held in Beijing in August of last year.
After a meeting with senior Chinese officials yesterday, he told the International facsimile service that "the reason is still the same as in the past, the lack of trust between the two sides, and the demands put forward by both sides."
After North Korea once again demanded that the United States promise to make concessions before the new round of six-party talks, Yin Yongkuan proposed that the talks be postponed for a long time.
Washington accused Pyongyang of setting preconditions for the new round of six-party talks.
The US is seeking North Korea's commitment to abolish nuclear weapons program.
North Korea said that if Washington lifted the economic sanctions against Pyongyang and resumed energy aid, it would freeze nuclear facilities.
In the past, North Korea also insisted on signing a non-aggression pact with the United States.
The end of the South Asia summit ended with the freezing of relations between India and Pakistan.
(AFP, Islamabad 6) the South Asia summit closed today. During the summit, the two opposing nuclear powers of India and Pakistan completed a breakthrough meeting, and the participating countries signed a free trade agreement, which is of epoch-making significance for the South Asian region.
At the closing session of the 12th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit, the prime minister of Bangladesh, Ms. Giya, pointed out that "the summit is an important watershed in strengthening regional cooperation in South Asia."
Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee and Pakistani President Musharraf met with Pakistani President Musharraf yesterday at the summit meeting for the first time since the end of the nuclear war between the two countries in 2002.
The hostility of the two major powers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has impeded regional development, and the leaders of the participating countries are encouraged by the momentum of peace that has clearly been brought about by the historic talks between India and Pakistan.
Ma Shude, a Pakistani military analyst, told AFP: "I believe that the positions of India and Pakistan have clearly changed and that the two countries are moving toward the peace process."
Pakistani Prime Minister al-Jaafari officially announced the closing of the summit and praised the important agreement on anti-terrorism, poverty alleviation, and the establishment of a regional free trade zone in 2006.
He also praised the summit as "a new dynamic for regional cooperation".
The heads of state and foreign ministers of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, margev, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka signed the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) agreement, the social charter, the anti-poverty plan, the anti-terrorism agreement and the Islamic Mehrabad declaration at the summit.

Children who have been denied access to school
(Agence France-Presse, Op. CIT.) - The United States Pastor Darko tinoo, who presided over the AIDS (AIDS) orphanage in the capital of Kenya, asked his children to be forced to remove their children from the HIV / AIDS virus.
Although it is estimated that 2.5 million people are infected with HIV in the country, AIDS and HIV are still taboo in Kenya.
It was alleged that many of the children had been denied access to primary school, in violation of the government's policy of full compulsory primary education.
"refusing to allow children to go to public schools, especially those infected with HIV, is an inhumane, illegal and serious violation of human rights. Education is a fundamental right, and the denial of these children is a violation of their rights."
A court order was sought to compel public schools to admit children to school, regardless of whether they were HIV carriers.
The Ministry of Education in Kenya, through a lawyer, said that it was not aware of the existence of such discrimination, but it was able to understand the practice of the school.
Garcia said that the Ministry of Education is willing to resolve this matter in consultation with the New Zealand children's house, located in the northern suburbs of Nabatiyah.
The result of the consultations was held today and the results will be returned tomorrow.
US expects to release hundreds of Iraqi prisoners
(AFP, Baghdad) Iraqi interim administrator Bremer, appointed by the US government, announced in his policy speech today that the US-led occupation alliance will release 100 Iraqi prisoners on the 8th and that hundreds of people will resume their freedom in the next few weeks.
Bremer, who is accompanied by the chairman of the Iraqi interim ruling Consultative Conference, also revealed that the new reward scheme, which is to assist the authorities in arresting all other priority wanted criminals, will receive a maximum of 200,000 US dollars in reward.
Badakki praised the aforementioned measures taken by the occupying coalition and said that it was the result of strong lobbying by the ruling Consultative Assembly.
He told reporters: "The ruling consultative conference has long been committed to spreading the spirit of reconciliation among Iraqi subjects. In order to achieve this goal, we have asked the alliance to review the issue of prisoners."
A spokesman for the occupation alliance, who did not want to be named, said later that a total of 506 prisoners were scheduled to be released in the next few weeks.
In his brief speech, Bremer told the reporter, "the alliance will release the first 100 prisoners tomorrow."
Bremer took the opportunity to make a gesture of reconciliation, at a time when the occupation alliance was trying to appease the lingering resentment of Hussein's society.
Hussein was captured alive by US troops eight months after his flight.
Bremer said, "Saddam Hussein has become a prisoner, and the vast majority of them have not been shot dead or have been arrested. They are now at a time of reconciliation."
The condition is that the prisoner "must renounce violence" and find persons such as the community or religious and tribal leaders to act as guarantors, and the guarantor is responsible for the good performance of those who have been released.
Bremer pointed out that those who are about to be released are not directly involved in violent incidents or other deadly attacks against the US military, nor are they involved in criminal or humanitarian crimes.
Bremer said that those who are about to be released "have made a mistake and have come to their senses". "We are prepared to give some of them a chance to rehabilitation."
WHO experts then went to Guangzhou to investigate the source of SARS.
(Agence France-Presse, Guangzhou, 10) - The World Health Organization (WHO) today launched the second investigation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) case in the southern part of China.
Earlier, the WHO had already conducted an investigation into the first confirmed case of SARS in the mainland in six months.
An expert group of the WHO and the Chinese health authorities raided a seafood and game restaurant in Guangzhou and tried to find out the source of a SARS case and another suspected case.
A spokesman for the WHO said in Guangzhou: "The trip was taken as a starting point for the review of the information we collected last time. We will try our best to mix some of the information."
At the same time, the Chinese government authorities have called on the public to fight against rats and other harmful animals that may carry the SARS virus.
Health officials used the above-mentioned seafood restaurant as a surprise test. This is a 24-hour business restaurant located at the center of the old urban area in Guangzhou. A 20-year-old female worker who worked here was officially diagnosed as a suspected SARS case Wednesday evening.
"We have carefully examined the possible environmental problems in the restaurant and will carry out further investigations."
"We talked with the restaurant staff to learn about the operation of the restaurant and then visited the food premises, and environmental experts would continue to do so," he said.
He said that since experts still have to sort out the data, it is still too early to determine the source of the disease.
US publicly supports the construction of an international thermonuclear experimental reactor in Japan
(Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 10) - for the first time, the United States openly supported the selection of a multi-billion US dollar "international thermonuclear experimental response stove" (ITER), rather than the Cadarache in the French town of Cadarache, and stated that Japan could provide an excellent site for construction.
The international thermonuclear experimental reactor will be planned to be built in cadarash, France, or six villages in Tsing Yi County in northern Japan.
The aim of the plan is to provide experimental sites for the modelling of solar nuclear integration, which is considered to be the most clean, safe and inexhaustible source of energy for the future.
However, it is generally expected that the plan will not be able to produce electricity by 2020.
At a meeting of Japanese business leaders during his visit to Tokyo, US Energy Secretary Abraham said, "I am honoured to say today that the United States strongly supports the construction of an international thermonuclear experimental reactor in Japan.
As far as the technical point of view is concerned, you can provide excellent sites. "
"The location of the six villages is very suitable for absorbing the huge amount of materials needed for the international hot nuclear experiment. Your well-known technology and engineering skills are the envy of the world. In addition, the local community has clearly welcomed the plan and tried its best to win the selection of the six villages."
A spokesman for the US Embassy in Tokyo confirmed that this is the first time that the Washington authorities have publicly expressed their support for Japan's bid for an international thermonuclear experimental reactor to be built in Japan.
An official from Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Science and Technology said: "We are greatly encouraged by the remarks made by Abraham.
We will continue to work with other countries to enable the international thermal nuclear experimental reactor to be built in six villages, "he said.

A spokesman for the New People's Army said in a television interview: "We no longer have any hope for peace talks with the Yahoo government, even though Arroyo has claimed that they are prepared to discuss the matter."
The Philippine government originally planned to hold a preliminary consultation with the Philippines later this month on the resumption of the formal peace talks.
He pointed out that the Philippines will ask candidates for the May presidential election to put forward their proposals on the resumption of the peace talks after the election.
Rohaal said that the Philippines is also prepared to request the removal of its name from the black list of terrorist groups in the United States and Europe as a prerequisite for the resumption of peace talks.
They were killed on the spot by three government army soldiers and four soldiers of the Philippine armed forces, and seven government soldiers were injured.

Syria rejects Israel's invitation to visit Syrian President
(Agence France-Presse, Damascus, 12th) - Israeli president khadov invited Syrian President Azerbaijan to visit Jerusalem today to hold talks on the peace agreement. Syrian officials refuted this invitation as "not in good faith" and accused the Israeli leader of attempting to avoid the Middle East peace process based on land for peace.
Earlier today, khadov said on the Israeli public radio: "I invite the President of Azerbaijan to come to Jerusalem to negotiate in earnest with Israeli leaders the conditions of the peace agreement."
He said: "Azerbaijan will be welcome, but it should not set a precondition."
In an interview with CNN, the Syrian foreign minister said that Israel must show that it is willing to resume talks four years ago.
The spokesman pointed out that khadov's move was not a "serious response" to President Azerbaijan's call for resumption of contact with Israel last month. He also accused President khadov of trying to gain access to the media.
The Syrian official news agency SANA quoted an anonymous senior official as accusing the president of Israel of attempting to circumvent the peace process in the Middle East based on land for peace.
The official said, "this is not a question of visiting or taking the initiative. The latest Israeli statement is aimed at evading the peace process."

Cracks in the chain of command of the largest rebel group in Lesotho
(AFP, Monrovia, 12) "the control over the control of the major rebel groups in the main rebel groups has become more and more intense, and a rebel leader has insisted that there is still power in Hong Kong.
In 1999, LURD stood up against former president Taylor's regime and ignited the four years of civil war in Lesotho, controlling about four fifths of the country's land.
In mid-August of last year, Taylor agreed to pave the way for a peace and consensus agreement between the former government, the rebels and the opposition parties on the basis of which the former government, the rebels and the opposition parties formed a transitional government.
However, a group that claimed to be a "military high-level command" accused Hong Kong of selling LURD's position in the transitional government, and announced a few days ago that they had replaced Hong Kong as the leader of the divorced wife of the country.
However, the founder of LURD, who is currently the speaker of the transitional parliament, insisted that only LURD's National Executive Committee has the power to dismiss the leader of the organization.
The day before yesterday, he told the media that "I created LURD in Nigeria. I can assure the people of Lesotho that LURD is not divided and nothing can destroy the conspiracy and the process."
D\ x {e58e} Wai has been manipulated by the leaders of the transitional government and other senior leaders who have served in the transitional government by the leader of the transitional government and other senior leaders who have served in the transitional government.
In October last year, blacken, a businessman, was appointed to lead this war-torn country to the general election in 2005.
The minister of justice, transport and labour, with the support of the Minister of Justice, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Transport and labour, in collaboration with Ireland, promised her to step down as soon as she was in Hong Kong.
He warned that if he continues to violate the peace agreement, the warring factions will return to Accra, where the peace agreement is being drafted, to discuss the possibility of replacing bled.

He told the investigators about the 1995 incident; the case was part of a 20-month investigation into the United States corruption scandal.
Rice refused to take bribes, and took the second round of the boxing tournament at Madison Garden Square.
The Daily News in New York has rushed to the residence of the Alabama State, asking him if he believed in the argument of rose, and he said: "It is not commensurate with the strength of the rice.
On the 6th, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) carried out a provisional examination at the headquarters of the company's headquarters in Las Vegas for the confiscation of financial and medical documents and computers.
The report says that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is also gathering evidence of losing and losing the game, including a champion boxing match between Morrison and Hoya in September.
US hopes Asian countries free from fear of mad cow disease
(AFP, Manila, 14th) US agricultural officials said that in spite of the outbreak of mad cow disease in the United States last month, Asian countries will be safe to eat American beef soon afterwards.
Although the United States discovered the first case of mad cow disease, it immediately stepped up security quarantine. Nevertheless, Japan and several Asian countries, such as South Korea, have immediately banned or restricted the import of American beef.
Officials from the United States said yesterday that the relevant units have expanded their investigation into the mad cow disease. The beef has not been exported in the first place. In addition, over the past 10 years, the relevant units have been strengthening quarantine in an effort to prevent the outbreak of mad cow disease.

(Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 14) South Korean officials say that after nine days of peace, South Korea has passed a new bird flu epidemic, and South Korea has stepped up quarantine work to curb the further spread of avian flu.
South Korea's Ministry of Agriculture said that an enhanced quarantine area has been set up in the vicinity of a chicken farm in Leung Shan area in the southeast of Seoul.
Officials from the Ministry of Health detected the bird flu virus in this region on Monday.
This is nine days away. South Korea has confirmed for the first time that the bird flu virus has been found.
Last month, avian flu broke out in 15 regions of South Korea, forcing the authorities to slaughter nearly 2 million chickens and ducks. This highly infectious poultry disease is obviously under control.
The director of the animal health unit of the South Korean Ministry of Health, Kim Chang Guofang, said, "We have killed all chickens in the epidemic area and strictly restricted the movement of these poultry."
The emergence of new cases of bird flu has prompted South Korean government officials to strengthen quarantine in other areas.
Kim Changda said that the bird flu virus can survive for two weeks in the dust, and can survive for at least 35 days in the excrement of the poultry.
Summit of the Americas to keep free trade zone
(Agence France-Presse, Monterrey, Mexico) - US President Bush's ambitious plan to set up a free trade area of the Americas next year has won the support of the leaders of the other 33 countries at the summit of the Americas today.
However, the countries participating in the meeting had divided views on how to combat the growing poverty in the western hemisphere, and the United States had not been able to include anti-corruption provisions in the final communiqu.
The free trade area of the Americas, from Alaska to Argentina, is said to be the largest free trade zone in the world, with a total population of about 800 million people, with a total production of US $13 trillion.
However, in his speech at the end of the two-day summit, the president of Argentina made a statement criticizing the plan of the United States. He said that the problems of the Americas could not be solved by the establishment of a free trade zone.
Brazil, the largest economy in South America, and Venezuela, the major supplier of oil in the United States, all opposed the inclusion of the issue of the Free Trade Area of the Americas on the agenda of the summit. However, after intense discussions, leaders of various countries announced their agreement to complete the negotiations on the establishment of a free trade area of the Americas by January 2005.
Iran's political struggle becomes more and more reformist, threatening the government's resignation
(Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 13th) - the question of the loss of candidates' eligibility for election in the National Assembly for the election of the National Assembly has once again increased, and a number of cabinet ministers have threatened to block the election of the reformist candidates unless the Conservatives have made concessions in order to ban the candidates from running in the election.
One of the vice presidents has warned that the decision of the Guardian Council of the constitution to cancel the election of thousands of candidates for the election of the National Assembly on February 20 could not be stopped, and the entire government might resign.
He said: "If the government thinks that it is unable to fulfill its duty of protecting civil rights and holding free elections, it will not become an option."
The governors of the 27 provinces of Iran have also said they want to resign collectively. People close to President Khatami have revealed that at least ten ministers have completed their resignations.
However, in response to media reports that President Khatami, who was acting moderate, was prepared to resign from office, it was denied by the assistant of Khatami.
Members of the reformist parliament, who were under indignation, continued their third day of sit-in demonstrations at the National Assembly building. They also said that even if they had to sit there for a few weeks, they would not hesitate to do so.
Eighty-three members of the reformist group were deprived of their qualifications and were unable to run for a second term.
The Iranian News Agency (IRNA) said that members of parliament had challenged the Guardian Council of the constitution to withdraw its ruling on disqualification.
The Guardian Council of the constitution is composed of 12 members. It is a non-elected political supervisory body. It is also a fortress against the reform of the right-wing forces of religion.
Ms. aibadi, the winner of the Iran Nobel peace prize, who is a hardliner, also said that she would visit the National Assembly to express her support for the sit-in demonstration by the reformist members.

The continuous decline in the labour force is bound to affect the economic production of the European Union and Japan.
(Agence France-Presse, damus 19), a study published today by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the consultant, Watson Wyatt Worldwide, pointed out that as a result of the shrinkage of the labour force, the value of the European Union's output in the global economy will be reduced by nearly half by the year 2020.
In contrast, the abundance of labour in developing countries such as India and China should help boost economic growth.
The executive director of Wyatt said: "The growth rate and productivity of the labour force will determine economic output.
In countries where there is a large shortage of labour, the supply of goods and services may not be able to meet the demand and standard of living, "he said.
The report, entitled "a better life: the economic impact of an ageing society", points out that thanks to the increase in human life as a result of medical progress, the continuous rise in the number of retired people, especially in developed countries, is bound to have a direct impact on economic production.
According to a statement issued in response to the study, "assuming that the current demographic and economic trends remain unchanged, the European Union's share of the global GDP will be reduced from the current 18 per cent to 10 per cent by the year 2020."
The statement also warned that "Japan's share will shrink from 8% to 4%."
Killing of works of art by ambassador to Sweden triggered diplomatic disputes between the two countries.
(Agence France-Presse, Stockholm, 18) - the art work of the Swedish National Museum of History in commemoration of Palestinian suicide bombers was damaged by the destruction of the Israeli ambassador to Sweden. Today, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon became a full diplomatic dispute as a result of the intervention of Israeli Prime Minister Sharon.
When he visited the Art Museum of the Stockholm antiquities museum last Friday, he met a diplomatic conflict between Israel and Sweden when he saw a piece of art showing photographs of the Haifa suicide bomber in October last year.
Sweden has asked Sweden to remove this piece of work, which has been rejected by Sweden.
It was widely reported in Swedish newspapers after the incident.
The exhibition is part of the forthcoming international conference on genocide to be hosted by the government of Sweden, which will also participate in the conference.
The video on the scene took pictures of the Israeli ambassador and put it into the water and put it into the water, resulting in a short circuit of the work, which was then ordered by the head of the museum to leave the museum.
Israeli Prime Minister Sharon arrived here today to turn the incident into a comprehensive diplomatic dispute.
The exhibit, consisting mainly of a vessel known as "white snow", was put on the sea at sea and was inserted in the bow at the bow as a boat.
Harardi was a Palestinian trainee lawyer living in Israel. In retaliation for the death of his younger brother by the Israelis, she launched a suicide bomb attack in Haifa in northern Israel in October last year, killing 21 Israelis and triggering a clash with Papua New Guinea.
He said: "I cannot tolerate this piece of art. It is also a great harm to the families of the victims of the Haifa bombing. I cannot be indifferent to such a piece of work that is reversing the facts."
The Democratic Party claims that the Baghdad bombings were evidence of the failure of the US policy toward Iraq.
(AFP, WASHINGTON, November 18) the US Democratic candidates who sought to replace Bush and entered the White House today pointed out that the latest suicide bomb attack in Baghdad, which caused heavy casualties, was evidence of the failure of the US policy toward Iraq.
The attack resulted in the death of at least 25 people and the wounding of 30 people. It was the deadliest attack in Baghdad since the US occupation of Iraq.
Bush's Democratic opponent strongly criticized Bush's Iraq policy. Some opponents claimed that the attack was the latest evidence of Bush's failure in the Iraq policy.
Senator Edwards of North Carolina told the Colombian broadcasting company, "our current policy has failed. I do not know that the government is not willing to change its approach."
"Obviously, the first thing we need to do is to internationalize the Iraqi security forces, and the other is to hand over the transitional government to the United Nations," he said.
In his public appearance, former President Carter said that the Iraq war led by the United States "has proved to be not only based on false intelligence and misleading statements," and the latest attack "continues to show that it is a tragedy."
Dickens has listed his opposition to the Iraq war as the main axis of his election campaign.
Iraqi guerrillas confront US military helicopters with high-tech weapons
(AFP, WASHINGTON, November 18) senior US military personnel said that the Iraqi resistance army has attacked the US helicopter with increasingly sophisticated weapons.
A group of senior officials familiar with a confidential report from the military said today to the New York Times that confidential military studies have found that Iraqi guerrillas used rocket-propelled grenades and more advanced thermal tracking surface-to-air missiles to attack US helicopters.
They said that this was a study carried out by Iraq prior to the three attacks on US military helicopters this month. However, the last three attacks will only confirm the conclusions of the study.
The main thrust of this military research report is to provide a means for US military pilots to avoid attacks by Iraqi guerrillas on such weapons, and the officials concerned are reluctant to discuss the contents of the new discoveries.
However, from the perspective of Iraq's new wave of attacks, people cannot help but worry that the Iraqi guerrillas have carefully studied the mode of operation of the US military plane.
Researchers have found that the Iraqi guerrillas have more than once used a-16 shoulder missiles, which is a matter of special concern.
It is very difficult for the pilot to avoid this type of missile with a precision navigation system.
A senior US soldier in the Persian Gulf region said: "Every time our plane was shot down, it was a big victory in the enemy's strategy.
The enemy considered this a very useful trick, not only in the media, but also in winning or losing. "
Since October 25 of last year, nine US military helicopters have been shot down or crashed. At least 49 US troops have died.
Carter pays tribute to Charles Dickens on the eve of the selection of the Democratic Party of the United States.
(Agence France-Presse, Hunan Province, 18) - Former US President Carter, on the eve of the presidential election of the Democratic Party for the first time, praised the candidates, the former governor of the state of Vermont, for his "courageous and candid" opposition to the Iraq war.
At his home town of Georgia, Carter told the reporter: "I have been particularly grateful for the courageous and candid attitude and position taken by Governor Dickens from the very beginning."
The Nobel peace prize winner said: "In the past year and a half, I have spent a lot of time strongly opposing the Iraq war, which is completely unnecessary and unjust.
Despite my great efforts, this war has been fought, and it is now proving that this war is not only based on false intelligence and misleading statements, but also continues to show that it is a tragedy. "
Carter praised the strong and powerful "advocates of peace". Although he was not officially endorsed by him in the statement, American television reported the remarks made by Carter.
The former governor of the northern state, Charles Dickens, is facing a middle line in the southern states, and retired General Clark from the state of Arkansas may be in a disadvantageous position. However, Carter's support may increase his chances of winning in the southern states with a conservative stance and a strong religious awareness.
At a recent television interview, Carter said that he believes the Democratic Party is the most likely candidate of the Democratic Party.

Clark, one of the Democratic Party's presidential nominations, claimed that Bush had created his own "axis of evil."
Two years ago, Bush created the term "axis of evil" to describe some countries that pose a threat to the United States.
Clark said, "it is an axis that threatens our future accounting policies, the foreign policy that threatens our security, and the domestic policy of killing the family."

However, he said the agreement reached should be broad in scope and include Pyongyang's pledge to accept verification in order to completely abolish the uranium enrichment program and plutonium again to deal with existing atomic weapons.
North Korea had produced the plutonium that they said to the unofficial representatives of the United States, but denied having any uranium enrichment program, and refuted the US claim that Pyongyang had admitted that there was a uranium enrichment program during the 2002 talks.

About 60 per cent of them died in new towns.
He said that the operation has not been ordered to be carried out immediately.
According to a report by the Indonesian state news agency, the authorities have used the British and Australian serums to carry out tests to determine the type of virus. However, the test results may not be released until Wednesday or fourth, and the government will report to the relevant international organizations.
Snow covers western Europe, causing heavy traffic and transportation chaos
(AFP, Paris, 29) the wind and snow cover most of the western and northern Europe, causing great traffic and railway chaos and forcing hundreds of flights from the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark to be cancelled.
In London, a spokesman for the Haifa airport said that the accumulated snow last night had led to the cancellation of more than 200 flights at the airport. As a result, 80 flights were grounded early this morning.
The other two airports near London were also affected by the accumulated snow. A total of 18 flights were cancelled due to weather conditions.
In Germany, winter weather led to the cancellation of at least 60 flights to Frankfurt International Airport, the largest airport in Germany.
According to the transport authorities, the remaining dozens of flights to Frankfurt were lost. Today, traffic in the sky is likely to be affected by the weather.
In France, road traffic restrictions were imposed in Paris after a period of snow last night, but similar measures in other parts of France were lifted this morning.
The services at the main airport in Paris were almost normal. Yesterday, as a result of accumulated snow and fog, there was a delay in the flight of Tai Ko Lok Airport.
The Paris airport authorities, however, suggested that passengers travelling by air should first find out whether their flights took off and off on time.
In addition to the Mediterranean coast, most parts of France are covered with snow.
More than two weeks will be the lunar new year. It is also one of the traditional festivals that Chinese people attach great importance to.
In this lively and happy life, we are accustomed to meeting with our close friends and exchanging gifts.
The Hongkong Post, in cooperation with China's postal service, will launch the "Hong Kong-China gift service" in the spirit of "transmission of opportunities and opportunities". This will enable the people of Hong Kong to send their wishes and blessings to their friends and relatives in the mainland or in Hong Kong during the Spring Festival.
Hongkong Post has all along been working closely with other postal administrations to provide the international service delivery service.
As early as December 2002, the wine logistics service was launched with Australia Post to provide quality products to the people of Hong Kong.
In co-operation with the Chinese Postal Service, the two sides have been working closely together on services such as postal service, postal remittance, courier service and so on, and launched the "China Hong Kong Gift service" in response to the increasing demand from the people of Hong Kong for the delivery of gifts to relatives and friends in the mainland.
For the first batch of gifts, the first batch of gifts, including candy, tea and seafood, and so on, have a great deal of choice.
No matter whether they are sent to relatives or friends in the mainland or business partners, they are all very honourable gifts.
Over the past 30 years, the Consumer Council's contribution to the protection of consumer rights is obvious to all.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the work of the Consumer Council, it is best to see whether there is any substantial improvement in consumer rights.
I agree with Mr Chan that after 30 years, not only the consumers are aware of their rights, but also the interests of consumers. This is the result of the efforts of the Consumer Council and the government.
The Consumer Council conducts regular tests on products and conducts market research and research on different products and services, and issues fair and objective market information to the public through a monthly magazine.
The "choice" magazine, which is widely trusted by the public, is now being used to develop an online version of the monthly magazine. This will be more effective in helping consumers gain access to market information.
The Consumer Council has 11 district consumer enquiry centres and 16 telephone hotlines to provide consumers with information on goods and services and to receive complaints from consumers.
Since the establishment of the Consumer Council, the number of enquiries received has increased from several thousand at the beginning of the 1970s to 146,000 last year, an increase of more than 20 times. This shows that more and more consumers will make reference to the report and views of the Consumer Council before choosing their products and services.
In addition, the Consumer Council has handled more than 26,000 complaints this year.
The Consumer Council will also name individual shops operated by unscrupulous traders. This will not only help consumers to beware of deception, but will also have a deterrent effect on the operators.
Mr Yeung, at the same time, I told you that I was watching television very carefully, and then I did a lot of reflection. I saw that the people had their aspirations and grievances and were dissatisfied with the government's administration.
In this respect, the government and I have been working hard to improve the economy and the people's livelihood in the past six or seven months. We have also made a lot of efforts in this respect. We are also aware of the many views expressed by the public on Article 23 of the Basic Law.
I also have a clear understanding of the demand for democracy in society.
However, Mr young, I would like to tell you that what I am doing today is to ensure that every incident can be carried out smoothly after the review of the political system. Therefore, we have to solve some basic problems first. These are two different things.
What are the basic problems?
Some are matters of principle. Some are legal issues, and they are related to the relevant ordinances of the constitutional review of the Basic Law. It is necessary to do a good job in this respect.
We are doing this part of our work, and a group of three has already started work in this area.
It will consult the Central People's Government and listen to their views in Hong Kong. I think this is a very good step. It is a decision taken by us to attach importance to the views of the Hong Kong community.
In today's competitive business environment, brand names play a key role in the success of products.
In order to create a brand name, it cannot be achieved overnight. It is necessary to have creative design, good quality, rich packaging, effective marketing and sustained investment.
Hong Kong has the conditions for creating brand names.
We have the knowledge, skills and experience, from design, manufacture, marketing to management, and we have a vast market.
The implementation of CEPA, which has just begun, will add to our advantages. In addition to the zero tariff preference for entry into the mainland market, the best advantage is to encourage businessmen to rack their brains and strive to increase the added value of their products so as to make their products a brand name for consumers in Hong Kong, the mainland and even the world.
The "Hong Kong 10 big name" election of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association is exactly the same as the implementation of CEPA to promote the development of Hong Kong products in the direction of high value-added activities.
Over the past five years, the election has given birth to 51 "Hong Kong's top 10 brands".
However, in the face of this huge market in the mainland, there is nothing wrong with 51 brand names. We need hundreds of thousands of people and more "Hong Kong brands".
Over the years, the MTRC has been actively participating in the mass transit railway projects in major cities in the mainland to bring their rich experience in Hong Kong into the mainland market.
I am very pleased that the quality of investment, professional services and management in Hong Kong is recognized in the domestic market.
This kind of exchanges between Hong Kong and Shenzhen will not only help the development of the motherland, but also create more development opportunities for Hong Kong businessmen. In addition to promoting the economy, Hong Kong will also be able to provide more job opportunities for Hong Kong.
I am most grateful to the central government and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone government for their support in terms of policy.
The Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) has come out of Hong Kong for the first time to take part in the development of the mass transit railway (MTR) in the mainland to further bring Hong Kong's brand into the mainland. This is indeed a pleasure for the people of Hong Kong and our compatriots in the mainland.
Here, I would like to wish the central government an early formal approval and approval by the central government. The project will be carried out smoothly, thus laying a stronger foundation for further exchanges and cooperation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
Today is the fifth day of the year. I am very glad to be invited by the Hong Kong gold and silver trading industry to attend the opening ceremony of the new year.
First of all, I wish you all a happy new year.
In the past year, the price of gold has risen sharply. It has recently made a breakthrough in the US $400 barrier, and the momentum has continued to be strong, reflecting investors' confidence in gold.
I believe that the industry has been very busy in the past year.
As a matter of fact, besides being affected by external factors, the economic boom has also reflected the achievements of the gold and silver trade in the past more than 90 years of hard work.
These efforts have not only laid the foundation for Hong Kong's Golden City, but also contributed much to the consolidation of Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre.
As the saying goes, "one year is the spring of spring." I hope that in the coming year, the gold and silver industry will continue to work hard to seize the "golden" time of the gold and silver industry, and take advantage of the demand for gold trade brought about by the reform of the mainland's gold market, China's accession to the WTO and the CEPA, and continue to promote the development of the market.
I believe that with the active promotion of the industry, the city of Hong Kong will be able to shine in the coming year.
Finally, I wish that the year of the Monkey will be active, with a flourishing business and a prosperous business.
Thank you.
However, the challenges of the past are not only for the financing of public housing, but also for the private sector.
The outbreak of the financial turmoil in 1997 led to the collapse of the asset bubble. As a result, property prices fell by 70%, causing the property owners to suffer a heavy blow. This is also the main cause of the repeated deflation in the past five years.
Now that the economy has improved, we are determined to maintain a stable environment to ensure the sustained and healthy development of the property market.
A healthy property market is indeed essential to the continued recovery of the Hong Kong economy.
We are also committed to protecting and improving the living environment.
Our future work will be based on the principle of sustainable development. We will adopt better urban design to enhance the protection of the natural and cultural heritage of Hong Kong and to improve the living environment.
We will pay more attention to the overall environment.
The lesson of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong last year reminds us of the need to focus on building a more spacious and healthy living environment.
We are stepping up efforts to beautify the environment, build a wide range of trees, and build more parks and recreational facilities for the benefit of the public.
I would like to thank members for their comments on the chief executive's policy address on the administration of justice and law, the political system, the civil service and the staff and security of subvented organizations.
Only Miss Margaret Ng and Mr Jasper Tsang have spoken on the administration of justice and legal services. They are the chairman and deputy chairman of the Legislative Council Panel on administration of justice and legal services.
In his policy address, the chief executive has proposed a number of measures to promote civil administration, including strengthening the liaison between principal officials and the community, conducting more public policy studies, enhancing co-operation between the government and the Legislative Council, and seriously carrying out a review of the political system.
The Department of Justice will fully participate in the above efforts to ensure that all government measures are in line with the law and procedures, in particular the basic law, including the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people, and, as Miss Margaret Ng has said, to uphold the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.
As a principal official, I will certainly try my best to understand the views of the community and the legal profession on issues affecting the administration of justice and the legal profession.
For example, the "Mainland / Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement" is the result of close co-operation between the government and the industry, including the Bar Association, the Law Society and the Hong Kong Association of notaries.
We have successfully incorporated "legal services" into the "arrangement" as one of the services industries open to the mainland. This has provided a new platform for co-operation in the provision of legal services between the two places, bringing both macro and long-term benefits to the legal services of the two places.
The work of the task force is a two-way street. We will reflect to the central authorities the work of listening to public opinion in Hong Kong.
From mid-January this year to now, we have received more than 10 organizations and individuals.
We all accept that Hong Kong's political development needs to be in line with the principle of "one country, two systems". The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is directly under the central government.
Most of them are of the view that the political system in Hong Kong needs to be improved, but at the same time, we accept that any development should be consistent with the Basic Law.
Groups and individuals also have their own views on individual procedural and legal issues.
The task force has referred these wishes, views and submissions to the central people's government.
In the coming month or so, the task force will continue to meet with other organizations and individuals. We will continue to convey the views received to the central authorities.
This is only the first meeting between the task force and the relevant central government departments. In the future, we still need to continue to follow up and communicate with the central authorities.
I believe we all understand that political development involves the relationship between the central authorities and the SAR. The central people's government has also examined the constitutional rights and responsibilities of the SAR government. We need to hold full discussions with the central authorities.
The West Kowloon Cultural District is a large-scale cultural and arts programme that has never been carried out in Hong Kong. It is not only a plan for the provision of cultural and leisure facilities for the public, but also a plan to enhance the quality of the people and the city.
The construction of the West Kowloon Cultural District belongs to the whole community of Hong Kong.
The government must continue to conduct in-depth discussions with all sectors of the community and draw on collective wisdom.
We understand that we should not only pursue the magnificent beauty of the buildings, but also enable them to achieve economic benefits and sustainable development, so as to improve the quality of life of the people.
Therefore, the government attaches great importance to the software package of the West Kowloon cultural and entertainment district. It must have relevant measures to tie in with the relevant measures, including the management policy of the facilities, the promotional strategy of the arts programmes, the contents of the exhibition and the publicity strategy.
The formulation of these relevant strategies must listen carefully to the views of the "users".
The younger generation, including each of your young friends, is one of the most important users of the West Kowloon Cultural District.
We hope that the people of Hong Kong, the people of Hong Kong and foreign tourists alike, will be able to stay there for a long time.
I understand that you have discussed the various aspects of the West Kowloon cultural and entertainment district this morning. Some of them have made a lot of efforts in producing special reports over the past month or so. I believe you are very familiar with the details of the project.
I am in a hurry to listen to the results of your discussions and to exchange views with you.
Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, global attention has been focused on ports, airports and border security.
As the largest port in the world to export to the United States, Hong Kong has undoubtedly responded quickly to the "port security initiative" proposed by the United States.
In addition, we believe that cutting off the lifeline of terrorist organizations is also an effective means to curb terrorist activities.
The large amount of capital flowing into the global financial system every day has made the law enforcement agencies concerned with the proceeds of crime and money laundering all the more difficult.
As the leading financial centre in Asia, we believe that cutting off the funds of terrorists may be one of the most effective ways of combating it.
At present, the legislature of Hong Kong is discussing various improvement proposals to tighten the existing legislation against the financing of terrorist activities and to actively cooperate with international standards and situations, such as the new recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF).
In addition, we are seeking to develop better information disclosure legislation to enable the relevant organizations and individuals to report suspicious transactions.
"balance" is also the key to this work: effective investigative powers, freedoms guaranteed by the constitution, personal privacy, and the efficiency of the economic and financial systems are all factors that must be taken into account.
Our control measures are based on the rule of law, transparency, fairness and efficiency.
As a matter of fact, the service industry in Hong Kong has an edge in many aspects.
Professional and business professionals in Hong Kong have an in-depth understanding of the business operation of the international community and the mainland.
Hong Kong's professional services such as accounting, finance, law and arbitration are the best partners in the process leading to the internationalization of mainland enterprises and their integration into the world market.
Our transport, construction, design and marketing services, management consultants, information technology, and conference and exhibition services will help enhance the overall productivity and competitiveness of enterprises in the mainland, and help enterprises and products to formulate strategies and enhance their brand image.
On the other hand, services such as tourism, medical care and insurance will help promote the development of relevant markets and industries in the mainland and raise the standard of services.
The close co-operation between the service industries of the two places will greatly enhance the respective strengths of the two sides and help them face up to the opportunities and challenges brought about by the globalization of the economy.
In order to promote the development of the professional services sector in the mainland market, the financial secretary and I have held substantive and valuable discussions with the relevant mainland authorities and their counterparts in Beijing last week on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and other issues of concern to the industry.
I am pleased to note that mutual recognition and co-operation agreements have been signed in the three professions of construction, structural engineering and insurance. This is an important step for the industry to develop in the mainland market.
Through this meeting, the professional bodies in Hong Kong have also established closer ties with the mainland regulators to provide a good basis for the next stage of friendly cooperation.
I believe that the vast majority of Hong Kong people love the motherland and Hong Kong.
In fact, the ties and relations between the mainland and Hong Kong in the economic, social, political and cultural fields have been closely related to each other before and after the reunification.
As far as the economy is concerned, we can see that since more than 20 years ago, the state promoted reform and opening up. Hong Kong's industries have the opportunity to move to the north and have new room for development. This has led to a narrowing of the relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland.
In recent days, we have further opportunities for closer economic and trade relations with the central government, as well as a new opportunity for the various services sectors in Hong Kong to participate more actively and extensively in the economic development of the mainland. This will further narrow the relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland.
In the area of social development, we have witnessed the rapid development of our country in recent years.
The people of Hong Kong are delighted to see Beijing's successful bid to host the 2008 Olympic Games.
A few months ago, when Yang Liwei visited Hong Kong, the people of Hong Kong were equally excited. Why?
It is because we feel that the country can have such an achievement. Every person and every citizen of Hong Kong is proud of it.
I understand that, as early as 10 years ago, the Legislative Council started to discuss with the government the issue of the long term office of the Legislative Council.
Similarly, over the past decade or so, the government has been considering a long-term plan for the relocation of government headquarters.
Therefore, I understand that the decision of the government to defer the development of the Tamar site, including the new Legislative Council building, will certainly disappoint some members of the Legislative Council.
I understand that during this period, members have some grievances to continue to work in places where the environment is poor.
However, as I have said to my colleagues who are equally affected by this decision, I hope that they will be able to understand the situation in the public interest and to be more patient during this period.
Earlier on, I explained to the Legislative Council Commission on a number of occasions that the government, having considered the current financial situation and the financial situation following the outbreak of atypical pneumonia last year, considered that it was not the right time to carry out the Tamar project or major office building works.
The construction of the new Legislative Council building at the Tamar site will help reduce the financial pressure of the government in the next few years and will be in the public interest and acceptable to the public.
The government will resume the construction of the new Legislative Council building at the Tamar site at a time when the public finances have improved, and we will do so now.
The state is very concerned about Hong Kong. The president and the prime minister are very concerned about Hong Kong. I know that they and the central government will do all they can to do a good job in this respect.
Therefore, no matter whether it is in the areas of tourism, finance, infrastructure coordination, traffic rights, zero tariffs on products, and services, good news will come one after another.
I also hope that with the recovery of Hong Kong's economy, Hong Kong will be able to make a greater contribution to the development of our country.
During my meeting with Premier Wen Jiabao, I also congratulated him on the remarkable achievements of his country under his leadership during a very difficult year. Although the future is still full of challenges, he is full of confidence, and we are all deeply encouraged by this.
Premier Wen also told me that the important exposition on "one country, two systems" made by Mr. Deng Xiaoping 20 years ago is of great significance to our comprehensive and accurate understanding of the principle of "one country, two systems" and is conducive to the future development of the political system.
He told me that the people of Hong Kong really had to seize this opportunity to concentrate on the development of the economy and the people's livelihood. He was full of confidence in Hong Kong.
Later, I will meet with the secretary of Guangdong Province, Mr. Zhang Dejiang, and the governor, Mr. Huang Huahua, to discuss with them how to build on the existing foundation and create a more win-win situation for our cooperation.
The last point is the "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong", which is familiar to all of us recently. This system is to govern Hong Kong by the people of Hong Kong who are the subject of the Patriot.
As for the Patriot, it is also very clear that it is necessary to respect the patriots of their own nation and sincerely support Hong Kong people who resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and do nothing to harm the country and Hong Kong. This is to use these patriots as the main body to govern Hong Kong.
I have to reiterate that the people of Hong Kong as a whole are patriotic.
What we are talking about here is not the ordinary people of Hong Kong, but people who are involved in the management of public affairs in Hong Kong. They are at the top of the executive, the Legislative Council and the judiciary.
When they are sworn in, they have to express their support for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China in accordance with the Basic Law.
The five or six principles and important considerations that I have mentioned above actually began to talk about the long-term future of Hong Kong in the 1980s. The formulation of the "Joint Declaration" and the formulation of the Basic Law have not changed and will not change.
Since the birth of the intellectual property system several hundred years ago, especially since the industrial revolution, it has given birth to another major invention of epoch-making significance.
Over the past 20 years, the intellectual property rights system has become a basic legal system and an important policy tool for countries to promote technological innovation. They have played an important role in revitalizing the economy and enhancing international competitiveness.
At present, with the rapid development of science and technology and economic globalization and the creation, possession and use of intellectual and intellectual resources, the quantity and quality of intellectual property rights has become an important foundation for all countries to participate in international competition.
Therefore, strengthening international exchange and cooperation in the protection of intellectual property rights is of great significance to the establishment of a just and rational new international economic order and the promotion of world economic prosperity and development.
The Chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property rights.
At the beginning of reform and opening up, China began to establish an intellectual property rights system. After more than 20 years of efforts, China has formed a relatively complete legal system for intellectual property rights, established an intellectual property protection system that combines judicial and administrative law enforcement, and has made important contributions to the promotion of scientific and technological progress and economic and social development.
Mankind has entered the information society in the 21st century, and the scientific and technological revolution will promote the development of social productive forces with unprecedented momentum.
Further improving China's intellectual property rights system and strengthening international exchange and cooperation in the protection of intellectual property rights is the requirement for China to expand its opening up to the outside world in the new century, as well as the need to build a socialist modernized country and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
We are willing to work together with other countries in the world to establish a fair and reasonable intellectual property system conducive to promoting science and technology and economic development in all countries, and to strive for the creation of a good environment for all mankind to respect knowledge, promote science, and protect intellectual property rights.
Speeding up the organization and institutionalization of organizations is the most important task facing the Shanghai Cooperation Organization at present.
Thanks to the efforts of all parties, considerable progress has been made in the preparation of the Secretariat and the regional anti-terrorist institutions.
We must redouble our efforts to ensure that the secretariat is officially launched this year and that regional anti-terrorist institutions will be established as soon as possible.
In order to reflect the great importance attached to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and as the host country of the Secretariat of the organization, the Chinese government has decided to provide the secretariat with office premises free of charge.
In the future, we will also continue to provide strong support for the smooth functioning of the Secretariat.
Deepening and expanding security cooperation has always been the focus of the work of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
We must not relax our guard against the "three forces" that seriously endanger the interests of all member states in the region.
We should make long-term and unremitting efforts to eradicate these evil forces and effectively safeguard peace and stability in the region.
In order to cut off the sources of funding for the "three forces" activities and to crack down on the "three forces" more comprehensively and effectively, we should put the anti-drug issue on a security cooperation agenda as soon as possible.
Economic cooperation is an important foundation and priority of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
Education is the cornerstone of modern civilization.
To improve the quality of our people and enhance our comprehensive national strength, we must vigorously develop the cause of education.
Rural education has a wide impact and is related to the overall situation of rural economic and social development.
Since the beginning of reform and opening up, tremendous and profound changes have taken place in China's urban and rural areas. This is inseparable from the development of education, especially in rural areas.
In rural areas, the implementation of the responsibility system for the contracting of household products has greatly liberated the productive forces.
The reason why a large number of rural and urban enterprises can be transferred to coastal areas and towns is one of the fundamental reasons for the massive expansion of the rural labor force in the rural areas. The basic reason for this is that there is a great deal of success in the education for universal compulsory education in rural areas.
At present, China's agriculture and rural economy are at a crucial stage of development.
The emergence of the new scientific and technological revolution in the world and the comprehensive construction of a well-off society have made higher demands on the scientific and cultural quality and ideological and moral qualities of the vast majority of the rural population.
Without a comprehensive "P 9" in the rural areas, and without a comprehensive increase in the quality of the peasants, it will be very difficult to achieve a well-off life for all people.
We must fully understand the basic, leading, and overall role of rural education in the overall construction of a well-off society.
Among the advisers and guests attending the meeting were senior leaders of well-known multinational companies, with internationally renowned economic experts and experts and scholars.
I am deeply impressed by the spirit of sincere co-operation and a positive and pragmatic attitude on the part of the consultants.
Giving full play to our spirit of cooperation and collective wisdom is not only conducive to planning and promoting the development of Guangdong, but also conducive to joint efforts to promote mutual cooperation and development in various fields.
I have always looked forward to the arrival of the international advisory committee on economic development in Guangdong in 2003 to listen to and understand your views on the economic and social development of Guangdong.
We have gathered here today for a common purpose: to strengthen cooperation and exchange, to expand the scope of development, to add vitality to the economic and social development of Guangdong, and to create opportunities for the development of your cause.
China's accession to the WTO marks a new stage in opening up to the outside world. We are participating in international competition in a wider scope, in a broader field, and at a higher level.
Guangdong is the province with the highest economic orientation in the mainland of China. It has been the first to feel the unprecedented development opportunities and severe challenges.
Against such a broad background, we must firmly grasp the new opportunities, meet new challenges, comprehensively enhance our international competitiveness, actively promote the process of modernization, strive to create a new situation of economic cooperation, and achieve mutual benefit, mutual benefit, long-term cooperation, and common development.
The people of Guangdong are concentrating on building a well-off society in an all-round way and speeding up the realization of modernization. This will create more opportunities and space for all our friends.
The Guangdong economy, which is full of vitality and broad prospects, is moving toward a new height with a strong attitude.
Recently, the Iraqi Interim Governing Council signed an agreement with the US occupation authorities in Baghdad, announcing a step-by-step move, to the timetable for the transfer of power in Iraq in June of next year.
This agreement was reluctantly accepted by the international community: while the EU foreign ministers' meeting was welcome, France believes that "this process is too slow," while UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said that "the time is not yet ripe for the United Nations to play a role in Iraq", while Russia simply questioned the legitimacy of the agreement.
The Iraqi people reacted coolly; public opinion in the United States even believed that "this is a major gamble."
All in all, people are more and more suspicious and have to wait and see.
There is no justification for the international community's doubts.
It is because people can see that it is not the United States that is willing to act in the United States. Therefore, the transfer of power is not likely to be complete, and it is bound to leave many promises.
First, the interim transitional government, scheduled to be formed in May next year, is not directly elected by the Iraqi people, but is elected by the "transitional National Assembly" elected by the 18 provincial election commissions.
This will be difficult to avoid being manipulated by the United States and its legitimacy may be questioned.
Second, after the United States announced the power transfer, the US military did not withdraw, but only turned the original "military occupation" into a "military presence."
The US government announced on November 18 that it has decided to impose quota restrictions on three categories of textile products imported from China.
At a time when China has made continuous efforts to expand economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States, this trade protectionism move by the US government cannot but be deeply regretted.
As the globalization of the economy has developed to the present, the new restrictions on the import of Chinese textiles by the United States appear to be out of date.
First, such an abuse of the "limits" has limited the implementation of the free trade principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
On the one hand, on the one hand, we talk about "free trade" on the one hand, and on the other hand, on the other hand, the "quota" is easily released, and trade barriers are rebuilt. Is this not too arbitrary and unfair?
Second, the "limit" limits the good development momentum of Sino-US economic and trade relations.
Since China and the United States reached an agreement on China's accession to the WTO in 1999, US exports to China have increased by an average of 15 percent.
From January to September this year, the US exports to China increased by 26.2 percent compared to the same period last year.
In the past two years, there has been a significant increase in the export of textile materials and manufactures from the United States to China.
In fact, China today has become the country with the fastest growth in exports from the United States to the rest of the world.
There are a number of reasons for the failure of Bush's visit to Britain. The most important reason is that after the end of the Cold War, the United States has become the only superpower in the world.
The United States, without the authorization of the United Nations, launched a war against Iraq and failed to respect the views of its major allies on major international issues such as the reconstruction of Iraq.
A recent public opinion poll released by the European Commission shows that 68 percent of EU citizens think that the reasons for the US starting the Iraq war are inadequate, and 53 percent of the people believe that the United States poses a threat to world peace.
Second, the United States emphasizes anti-terrorism, asking the allies to make funds, but not paying attention to issues of concern to them.
With regard to the Iraqi reconstruction project, the United States stuck tightly in the hands of the palm and the main contract for bidding for the first time to its own companies. The World Trade Organization had ruled that the United States would make concessions, but the British business community had hoped that Bush would make a concession, but it did not make a clear statement at the end.
Third, the United States has put its own values above other countries as the highest criterion. It must insist on the democratic transformation of the countries of the Middle East. Some allies demand that the United States respect the culture and characteristics of the Islamic countries.
However, Bush will not change his course because of widespread criticism and opposition. During his visit, he once again defended his Iraq policy, stressing that the US-British coalition forces will continue to use force to deal with violence in Iraq.
Since Bush's visit to Britain has been unsuccessful, the situation in Iraq may not necessarily develop as the White House hopes.
After six months of debate, the advance team of Japan's Self-Defense Forces will finally go to Iraq by the end of 2003.
This is the first time Japan has sent troops to an overseas battlefield since the end of World War II.
It reflects the will of Japan to become a political and military power, and also indicates that Japan's defense strategy has begun to change.
The reason why the self-defense forces are so eye-catching is that it is not an isolated incident.
Japan took the opportunity of the Afghan war to achieve a breakthrough for the Self-Defense Forces to go out of the country; through the Korean Peninsula issue, it passed the "emergency legal system"; and recently the Koizumi cabinet adopted the "basic plan for supporting the reconstruction of Iraq" to pave the way for sending troops to Iraq.
This step, step by step, has finally broken through the restrictions of the Japanese constitution of peace and achieved the goal of sending troops to the overseas battlefield.
In addition, Japan is also preparing to amend the "concept of basic defense forces" in 2004 in order to send troops overseas into law and make it permanent. It is also intended to establish a "permanent force" for overseas deployment.
At the same time, the Japanese cabinet held a decision to deploy the missile defense system at the beginning of 2004 on the pretext of the so-called "North Korean missile threat," and introduced the United States' "standard -3 missiles" and "Patriot - 3" missiles to intercept missiles from the atmosphere and re-entry into the atmosphere.
It is not hard to see that the Japanese Self-Defense Forces are developing in the direction of the regular army, which is "defensive and offensive," and that the so-called "self defense force" of the so-called "exclusive defense" seems to exist in name only.
The reason why Japan's actions are cause for concern is, first of all, because these military decisions are a blow to Japan's peace constitution.
After paying homage at the Yasukuni Shrine, Koizumi gave an interview to Japanese reporters and defended his actions.
The arguments are contradictory, and there are all kinds of loopholes.
The reporter asked why Koizumi paid homage to the shrine. Koizumi answered that "Japan's peace and prosperity have been achieved on the basis of the victims of war.
My visit is to pray for peace and prosperity in Japan. "
May I ask whether Koizumi's so-called "war victim" also includes Hideki Tojo and other Class-A war criminals of World War II?
Can it be said that Japan has made a basic contribution to the achievement of peace and prosperity in Japan after the war?
A reporter asked why he chose to visit the Yasukuni Shrine on January 1.
Koizumi said that the visit to the shrine on the first day of the new year was a Japanese tradition. Many people went to the shrine to pay their respects at the shrine.
It is understandable that ordinary people pay tribute to their relatives and friends, and many of the bereaved families have made it clear that their visits to the Yasukuni Shrine are only to pay tribute to their loved ones and friends, and resolutely oppose the worship of class A war criminals at the Yasukuni Shrine.
The Chinese people are justified. We have always insisted on separating the Japanese people from a handful of militarists and separating ordinary people from right-wing elements. Ordinary people's visits to the Yasukuni Shrine are not the crux of the problem.
Unity means strength.
This is an indisputable truth.
To achieve the grand goal of comprehensively building a well-off society and completing the sacred cause of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, we must unite all forces that can be united.
The work of the patriotic united front in the new century and the work of the People's Political Consultative Conference must be the fundamental starting point and the end result.
We must further adhere to and improve the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, further consolidate and develop the patriotic United Front, mobilize all positive factors to the fullest extent, and constantly add new strength to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
In the past year, the CPPCC has firmly grasped the two major themes of unity and democracy, conscientiously carried out various functions, and played an important role in promoting the overall development of China's economic and social development and safeguarding the overall situation of reform and development.
In the new year, it is hoped that the CPPCC will closely focus on the central work of the Party and the state, further carry out the work of political consultation, democratic supervision, and participation in political affairs, carry forward the fine tradition, carry out in-depth investigation and study, and make a new and greater contribution to the comprehensive construction of a well-off society.
From 4 to 6 January, the twelfth summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which was postponed for a full year, ratified the South Asian free trade agreement framework treaty, the additional protocol to the SAARC convention on combating terrorism and the South Asian Social Charter, and declared that the SAARC countries are committed to joint development and cooperation in the economic, cultural and anti-terrorism fields.
During the SAARC summit, Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee and Pakistani President Musharraf's bilateral meeting attracted special attention.
In the last summit, the handshake between Musharraf and Vajpayee did not give people too much hope for the development of the relations between the two countries.
Two years later, since the two sides have adopted a series of major measures, such as restoring normal diplomatic relations, transportation links, and bringing about a ceasefire in the Kashmir region, the relations between India and Pakistan have continued to relax and eventually reached the highest level through the SAARC summit.
The two countries have made a big step forward in the process of improving bilateral relations, and regional cooperation in South Asia is taking a new turn for the better.
Although Indian Foreign Minister Singh said on the 4th that the meeting was a "courtesy", it is believed that the meeting means that India and Pakistan will continue to move toward a more positive and pragmatic direction.
The leaders of the two countries have realized that tension and confrontation are not in the interest of their own countries. On the contrary, they have lost their chances of economic development.
With the further development of economic globalization, strengthening cooperation and revitalizing the economy have become the top priority of the two governments.
Despite the fact that the results of the presidential election held in Georgia on the 4th have not yet been officially announced, the candidate nominated by the right-wing political party and the leader of the National Movement, Saakashvili, have won.
The Central Election Commission announced on the 7th that according to the statistics of 89% of the votes, more than 95% of voters supported Saakashvili.
A number of heads of state of the Commonwealth of Independent States also sent a message of congratulations to the young politician.
In fact, as early as the end of the election, Saakashvili had already announced his victory.
He said that the result was "a victory for the people" and said that Georgia would act quickly to create a new future.
In an interview with the news media, many voters said that giving votes to Saakashvili meant "new hope".
Even former President Shevardnadze, who was forced to resign, also expressed his support for this former political opponent and praised his "young, energetic, and well educated education."
While placing hope in Saakashvili, people also noticed that in the two months since Shevardnadze's resignation, the situation in Georgia has not changed significantly.
It can be said that the newly elected president will continue to face old problems.
The past year has been an important and extraordinary year in the development process of our country.
We carried out an arduous struggle against the sudden SARS outbreak and achieved a major victory in phases. Our economy has maintained a good momentum of development; the per capita gross domestic product has reached a new level, and the "Shenzhou 5" manned space flight has become a reality; national unity, social progress, and the people's livelihood have further improved.
The achievements of all sides in our country have attracted worldwide attention, and the people of the whole country have made tremendous efforts to this end, demonstrating their courage and strength to make a miracle.
Looking ahead to the new year, we are full of confidence and hope.
Looking at the international situation at home, our country is in the midst of an important strategic opportunity period that must be tightly grasped and can accomplish much.
We must adhere to the spirit of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thinking of the "three represents," comprehensively implement the spirit of the 16th CPC Central Committee and the 16th plenary session of the 16th CPC Central Committee, conscientiously implement the central authorities' guidelines and overall plans for this year's work, and continue to push forward reform, opening up, and modernization.
To do a good job in this year's work, we must correctly grasp the situation. We must see the favorable conditions and new opportunities as well as the unfavorable conditions and new challenges, and strengthen our sense of responsibility, sense of urgency and sense of worry.
The tripartite talks on the Iraq issue were held at the UN headquarters in New York on the 19th. UN Secretary General Annan held consultations with representatives of the Iraqi provisional governing council and the interim administration of the US-British coalition forces, focusing on how the United Nations can play a role in the reconstruction of Iraq.
The talks involved Iraq's political, humanitarian, security, and the appointment of a special representative of the United Nations in Iraq, among other things. The three parties had a frank exchange of views on this issue.
The US and British programmes for the transfer of power in Iraq are at a critical juncture. Whether and how the United Nations will intervene in the reconstruction of Iraq is naturally a focus of attention.
Since the United States announced the end of major battles in Iraq in early May of last year, the situation in Iraq has continued to be volatile and attacks against the occupation have taken place one after another, resulting in heavy casualties among the US-British coalition forces.
Former Iraqi President Saddam was arrested on 13 December last year, but the joy of the United States has not been sustained and the security situation has not improved. The escalation of the resistance movement has plunged the occupation authorities into a predicament.
On the other hand, the Iraqi people and the Arab countries unanimously demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops and the return of the Iraqi people to the management of the country by the Iraqi people.
At the same time, the United States and Britain have sought to rebuild the Iraqi regime according to their will and, on this basis, gradually get rid of their "dignity."
To this end, the way and process of the transfer of power has become the focus of the current Iraqi affairs.
The power transfer concept proposed by the US and British administrations in November last year is that the Iraqi interim transitional government, which was formed before 1 July this year, will be elected by the "transitional National Assembly." However, representatives attending the congress will be selected by the "provincial election committee."
However, the Shiite population, which accounts for the majority of the Iraqi population, emphasized that national direct elections should be held in a truly equitable manner in Iraq.
US Secretary of State Powell's recent visit to Russia continues to be a focus of public opinion.
This is because the United States and Russia are very important, and their mutual relations have far-reaching effects on the world today.
What is more important is that Powell's trip to Moscow has a substantive content and sends a clear signal: there is a dark cloud in the sky of Russia and the United States.
If these clouds are not dispersed in time, the prospects for relations between the two countries may become bleak.
Although the channels of dialogue between Washington and Moscow are very clear, Powell has decided to make an article in Russia, which is quite influential, to clarify his position.
Powell pointed out in his article that the United States is puzzled by the series of incidents in Russia's internal affairs and foreign affairs over the past few months.
He believes that the Russian regime has not yet fully accepted the restrictions of the law, and that the key elements of civil society such as the freedom of the press and the development of political parties are not strong enough.
The policy pursued by Russia in Chechnya and its attitude toward the neighboring countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States are all the more worrying to the United States.
In the eyes of diplomats, making public statements through the mass media is the "final method" for communicating information.
The original intention of the United States to make such a choice is interesting. It is obvious that Russia feels embarrassed and unhappy about it.
After entering the new century, economic globalization has become a major and serious challenge facing African countries.
The leaders of African countries have become more and more aware of the fact that Africa can no longer afford to take the opportunity to seek solutions.
On 9 July 2002, the African Union was formally established and became operational. Since then, African countries have been actively pursuing the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) in an effort to develop the economy as soon as possible and to resolve the major obstacle to the cause of African recovery - armed conflict - in order to create an environment of solidarity, peace and stability.
At present, the overall situation in Africa is getting more relaxed, the hot spots have cooled, and all countries have increased the sense of urgency to end the armed conflict.
With the strong support of the United Nations and the international community, African influential regional organizations, regional powers and prominent politicians have taken positive steps to intensify efforts to resolve regional conflicts and eliminate civil strife, and some of the conflicts and upheavals that have lasted for many years are basically under control.
In July, the government of the Sudan and the rebel forces began to hold talks on the peace process in Kenya. In October, the government of the Sudan and the rebel forces began to hold peace talks to discuss the peace process in the country. In October, the government of the Sudan and the rebel forces signed a peace agreement.
Of course, the stability of the African region is still relatively fragile, and the results of peace need to be consolidated, while some of the potential or actual armed conflicts remain to be resolved.
At the same time, the pace of economic development in African countries still lags far behind that of developing countries such as Asia, which are a negative factor in the development of Africa.
How the African countries can effectively cope with the challenges of economic globalization and realize the dream of African Renaissance will also require long-term and arduous efforts on the part of the people of Africa.
Recently, an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemic has occurred in some parts of our country.
The party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to this, quickly make a series of major decisions, and clearly put forward guidelines and policy measures for prevention and control.
All relevant localities and departments must act urgently to prevent the spread of the epidemic in accordance with the plans of the Party Central Committee and the State Council.
At present, the national effort to prevent and control avian flu is being carried out in an orderly and orderly manner.
The highly pathogenic avian flu is a kind of animal disease that is fast spreading and harmful to the people. It has seriously endangered the production of animal husbandry and seriously endangered the health and safety of the people.
To effectively do a good job in the prevention and control of the highly pathogenic avian flu, the health and safety of the people are related to the overall situation of economic development and social stability.
As the world's largest debtor, the foreign debt of the United States is on the increase.
The US Treasury Department announced on January 16 that as of the end of September last year, the total amount of debt owed by the United States to various categories of foreign creditors was US $6.49 trillion, 2.2% higher than the previous figure.
On average, each American has a foreign debt of more than US $20,000.
It is a coincidence that one week ago, the International Monetary Fund published a research report system that sharply sounded the alarm for the financial base of the United States, and pointed out that the US foreign debt, which continues to break through the record, has reached a level that threatens global financial stability.
Statistics show that some 40 per cent of United States government bonds are controlled by foreign private investors.
In the first half of the twentieth century, in the first half of the twentieth century, Keynes offered to President Roosevelt a deficit policy to stimulate the economy, and the fiscal deficit was resolved through external borrowing.
This has indeed played an important role in stimulating "effective demand" in order to solve the urgent needs of the economic crisis.
However, it has been seen that many governments in the United States tend to use this as a panacea.
However, since President Reagan advocated tax cuts and expansion of the army in the 80's of the 20th century, the US fiscal deficit has gradually increased and has eventually become the biggest debtor.
The convening of the first round of six-party talks is an important step in the process of peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.
Some common points formed by the various parties during the talks have laid the necessary foundation for the talks to continue, and further clarified the objectives, channels, and guidelines for resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.
Over the past few months, all parties concerned have insisted on a peaceful settlement of the peninsula nuclear issue through dialogue, and conducted extensive coordination and consultations on the basis of the results of the first round of six-party talks, and made unremitting efforts to hold the second round of talks as soon as possible.
At the same time, the DPRK and the United States have further demonstrated varying degrees of flexibility.
At present, important progress has been made in the preparations for the talks.
What can be achieved through the second round of the six-party talks, and whether the process of peace talks can be maintained is a matter of general concern to the parties concerned and to the international community.
Regarding this, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that the goal of the six-party talks is to maintain and promote a peaceful solution to the dialogue, and we are willing to work together with the parties to this end.
The basic starting point of the Chinese side is to safeguard peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and to realize a nuclear-free peninsula.
The Chinese side believes that as long as the participating parties insist on the sincerity of peace talks, mutual respect, and consultations on an equal footing, they will be able to create favorable conditions for promoting the resolution of the relevant issues.
At the end of the 1970s, Murray relations deteriorated, and in 1981 the two countries severed diplomatic relations.
President Reagan of the United States has listed a long list of charges for Lee's leader Qaddafi, for example, the secret development of nuclear weapons, military intervention and terrorism, and so on.
Between the two sides, the two sides were engaged in hostilities, and the United States launched two surgical attacks on the "grassland fire" and "golden valley".
Since then, the United States has imposed sanctions on the economy, carried out political attacks, and carried out diplomatic checks and threats.
And Qaddafi, who was under heavy pressure, did not yield.
At the moment, the Murray relationship has returned, and some people have attributed this entirely to the deterrent effect of the Iraqi war, which seems to be biased.
As a matter of fact, for many years, Qaddafi, who has a unique character, has struggled against the United States. On the other, he has been giving an olive branch to the United States. Unfortunately, he has not received any response.
After the end of the Iraq war, the various parties in the Middle East adjusted their strategies and formed a new combination of regional forces, which provided an opportunity for the resumption of diplomatic relations.
In the case of Khadafi, reconciliation with the United States can put an end to the sanctions, revitalize the economy, improve people's livelihood, and break away from isolation and integrate into the international community.
If we give up those things that are not yet available and are not available for the time being, we will be able to change the new environment in another village.
From 7 to 8 February, political leaders from Europe and the United States, as well as other parts of the world, gathered in Munich, Germany, to attend the fortieth session of the Munich Security Policy Conference.
The so-called "Munich Security Policy Conference" is an international security forum founded by unofficial members of Germany and funded by the German government. It has received increasing attention in recent years, especially after 11 September, and has been praised as the "Davos Forum" in the security field.
One of the important topics of this conference is transatlantic relations.
Remarks made by European and American political leaders showed that the two sides are doing their utmost to shake off the shadow brought about by the Iraq war and to work hard to return to the track of cooperation.
Bertra, director of the Berlin Institute for International and Security Affairs, said that this is a meeting to restore relations between the United States and the United States, and that both sides have a desire to move closer.
As far as Europe and the United States are concerned, the new message from the meeting is that Europe and the United States need to resume dialogue, and they need to seriously consider the common tasks facing the two sides and find a meeting point for the purpose of completing these common tasks.
Compared to last year's meeting, the smell of this year's session has disappeared and the positions of the two sides are close.
In spite of the fact that the "old Europe" represented by France and Germany is still concerned about the Iraq war launched by the United States, it has said that it wants to "look forward."
German Foreign Minister Fischer said at the meeting: Although we hold different views on the war, we must work together to ensure peace after the war in Iraq. For this we must look ahead.
He also said that although Germany will not send troops to Iraq, Germany will not prevent NATO from playing a direct role in Iraq.
The United States, which has gained an advantage in the field of modern media, has monopolized a large part of the international press, and its propaganda campaign has long been exposed to the world. Why is there a huge amount of money to set up a satellite TV station specially designed to cover 22 countries in the Middle East?
In the words of the person in charge of the "Freedom 1" television station, it is to provide Arab countries with a "comprehensive and fair" news platform.
However, some analysts pointed out that the "Freedom 1" will be a strategic weapon for the United States to carry out public opinion and cultural invasion and attack against Arab countries. It is an important propaganda tool for the United States to carry out the policy of integrating the Middle East and reforming the Islamic world.
In view of this, the mission of "freedom No. 1" is unusual, and there are roughly three alternatives: first, to disseminate the concept of "freedom of freedom."
The United States believes that Islamic civilization is a serious obstacle to the advancement of modern civilization in the West. The extremist religious forces of the Islamic countries in the Middle East are the breeding ground for international terrorism, characterized by anti-American terrorism. To effectively combat terrorism, the Islamic world must be transformed to recognize and accept Western values, lifestyles, and political systems.
The United States has tried to impart its ideology and its ideology to the Arabs through the intangible effect of the "Freedom 1" program.
The second is to improve the image of the United States.
In a series of international issues, the United States has done its best in a series of international issues, and its hegemonic acts have made the Arab countries and the Islamic world angry.
After the "9 / 11" incident, the contradictions between the United States and the Islamic world in the Middle East, which have always been biased toward Israel, have tended to intensify.
In the absence of conclusive evidence and the authorization of the United Nations, the United States occupied Iraq by force in the name of eliminating weapons of mass destruction and anti-terrorism. This has aroused strong resentment among the Muslim population.
Talks between Pakistani and Indian officials were held in Islamabad from 16 to 18 February, and the hope for peace was once again raised on the South Asian subcontinent.
Officials from the two countries set the agenda and modalities for future talks and established a mechanism for continuing dialogue, marking the resumption of the dialogue between Pakistan and India after a break of two years, laying the foundation for the two countries to gradually resolve all outstanding issues, including the Kashmir dispute.
Prior to this meeting, although the relations between the two countries had been filled with a series of goodwill moves by the two sides, most of the analysts were still cautious about the prospects for the peace process.
It is no wonder that it is not surprising to recall that in recent years there has been a sharp rise in the relationship between Pakistan and India. It seems that no one dares to guarantee that today's exposure to the negotiating table will not become a flash in the border tomorrow.
However, the voice of the two countries, which was read out with a smile on 18 July by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, has once again spread the mood of optimism to the eyes of many people who have long been concerned about the situation in South Asia.
First, the timetable set by the talks was very operational, and the two sides not only identified specific time and issues for the talks, but also set different levels of talks according to the importance of the topics.
Second, the two sides learned from the direct dialogue between the leaders of the two countries in July 2001, leading to the failure of the talks, and adopted a "step by step" dialogue to enable the level of talks to start from low to high, so as to make adequate preparations for the high-level dialogue.
Once again, after several rounds of bilateral relations, the two countries agreed that war is not a good way to resolve disputes, and that the two sides should stay away from war. This consensus has laid the foundation for the future leaders of the two countries to reach an understanding that "Pakistan and Pakistan will never again fight."
To comprehensively and accurately understand and implement the principle of "one country, two systems", it is necessary to unify "one country" with "two systems", "patriotic" and "loving Hong Kong", so as to ensure that Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and the sovereignty of the state should be respected.
Only in this way can we effectively safeguard the well-being of our compatriots in order to meet the long-term interests of the state and the people as a whole.
Since the reunification, the central government has unswervingly implemented the principle of "one country, two systems" and acted in strict accordance with the Basic Law.
The vast majority of Hong Kong compatriots enjoy unprecedented democratic rights as masters of ownership.
With strong support from the central government and the mainland of the motherland, Hong Kong has overcome various risks and challenges, such as the impact of the Asian financial crisis, and continues to maintain its status as an international financial, trade, and shipping center.
Practice has proven that the principle of "one country, two systems" has great vitality.
Today, when we republish Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech 20 years ago, he once again announced to the world the strong determination of the central authorities to implement the principle of "one country, two systems." It is also aimed at giving everyone a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the principle of "one country, two systems" and pushing forward the great practice of "one country, two systems."
Today, the Party Central Committee and the State Council held a grand gathering of national science and technology awards here.
President Hu Jintao presented the award to Liu Dongsheng and Wang Yongzhi, who won the national science and technology award for 2003.
The "China manned aerospace project" project, which won the principal award of the National Science and Technology Progress Award, and the scientific and technological workers who won the 2003 National Natural Science Award, the State Technology Development Award, and the State Science and Technology Progress Award, were presented by the General Assembly.
On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, I extend warm congratulations to all the winners.
We would like to extend sincere greetings and lofty greetings to the scientific and technological personnel on all fronts throughout the country!
For the first 20 years of this century, for our country, it is an important strategic opportunity period that must be tightly grasped and can be accomplished.
We must concentrate our efforts on building a more affluent society that benefits more than a hundred million people.
To use this strategic opportunity period to strive for something, we must put the development of science and technology in a more important and prominent position.
After the "9 / 11" incident, US President Bush dished out a "pre-emptive" strategy in June 2002, put it into practice in US Foreign Relations, and launched the first "pre-emptive" war in Iraq in March last year.
The "pre-emptive" concept not only runs counter to the norms of international law, which is at the core of "mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity," and will inevitably give rise to a dangerous effect, which will lead to a new turmoil in the international order.
At the beginning of the "pre-emptive" theory, some political figures in the United States asked this question: "If other countries follow suit, what can we do?"
As a result, over the past two years, more and more countries have claimed to be "pre-emptive", and the "pre-emptive" ranks are expanding.
This is a new trend that warrants our attention and research.
In the month when Bush proposed the "pre-emptive" strategy, Australian Prime Minister Howard came out for the first time to express his support.
He said that as soon as reliable information on the terrorist attacks on Australia is obtained, Australia will adopt a "pre-emptive" strategy against it and will not hesitate to take military action in neighboring countries.
He even suggested that the principle of "pre-emptive" should be included in the Charter of the United Nations and that it was necessary to amend the Charter of the United Nations to give countries "pre-emptive" rights in order to combat terrorists or countries that support terrorist activities.
In the Northeast Asia region, Japan's defense agency pointed out in the "Defense White Paper" published in July 1999 that Japan could launch a "preemptive strike" against foreign bases before facing a missile attack or military invasion.
After the Iraq war, the voice of Japan in advocating the "pre-emptive" strategy was even more rampant.
Recently, international public opinion has commented extensively on the current African policy of the United States.
The "foreign policy focus" published by the United States in January this year published the "African policy outlook for 2004". The article says that in the past year, the foreign policy of the Bush administration has had a direct or indirect impact on Africa, especially since the United States has shown great concern for the fight against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
It will be recalled that, in order to show concern for Africa, the Bush administration, in January last year, formulated a "presidential contingency plan for the treatment of AIDS" and promised to provide at least US $3 billion in funds to Africa each year.
In July last year, President Bush paid a visit to five African countries, such as Senegal, South Africa, Botswana, Uganda and Nigeria, promised to assist African countries in the fight against AIDS; another $100 million was used to combat terrorist activities in Africa.
These assistance programmes, once welcomed by African countries, have won a great deal of praise at the international level.
However, one year has passed and the concrete actions of the United States have been delayed for a long time.
Africa is in urgent need of assistance.
In an effort to reduce hunger and poverty, promote health and education in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations in 2000 and to promote health and education, Africa has established a new partnership for Africa's development.
The United Nations has repeatedly appealed to developed countries to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to official assistance to the least developed countries.
However, official United States assistance accounted for only 0.1 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP), which was far from the United Nations request and was ranked last in the list of donor countries.
Public opinion in Europe has recently been discussing a hot topic: whether German Chancellor Schroeder, French President Chirac and British Prime Minister Blair's "three magnates" have gradually become institutionalized.
Public opinion has called the "three giants" of Germany and France as the "new troika" of the European Union, while the relations between the three countries have been referred to as the "new triangle."
The "new triangle" is something new, and it is still waiting to be observed. However, from any point of view, the "new triangle" seems to be beneficial to the European integration process, thus helping Europe to play an important role in the international arena as a multipolar world.
Looking at the history of Europe in the past 100 years, one of the basic characteristics of the relationship between Germany and France is that Britain and France unite to restrain or resist Germany.
The two world wars were proof of this.
During the Cold War, the East and West Germany were suppressed, respectively, in China and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Since the end of the Cold War, Germany has become more powerful since the end of the Cold War, with an imbalance in the pattern of Western European power.
However, in recent years, with the reopening of the "Germany and Germany axis" and the fierce collision between the world's single-polarization and multipolarization concepts, the EU has been seriously divided on the Iraq issue:
The "old Europe" represented by Germany and France is diametrically opposed to the position of the "new Europe" represented by Britain and Poland on the Iraq war.
And this split happens to be the largest expansion in the history of the European Union.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak gave a speech on the reform of Arab countries in Cairo a few days ago. He criticized the practice of imposing a single reform model on Arab countries, and warned that such an attempt would only be counter-productive and would not benefit the security and stability of the Middle East region.
He believed that the reform measures should be carried out according to their respective characteristics, and that a single reform model ignored the cultural background, social customs and religious identity of different countries.
He also pointed out that the Arab countries welcome outside help in the reform process, but such efforts should recognize different national conditions and respect the will of all countries, thus promoting the political, economic, and cultural reform process in the Arab countries.
These remarks by the Egyptian leadership represent the common view of the Arab countries.
At present, under the pressure of anti-terrorism, non-proliferation, and democratic reform, the Middle East, as one of the hot spots in the world, is brewing new upheavals and will lead to new integration.
After the war between Afghanistan and Iraq, how can Iraq carry out political reconstruction, which was regarded by the United States as one of the "axis of evil"?
How will the various political and social patterns in the Middle East region evolve?
This is not only the concern of the Arab world and the international community, but is also of interest to the United States and its Western allies.
After meeting with visiting Bahraini Crown Prince Salman in Washington on 9 April, US Secretary of State Powell reiterated that the United States will launch a "Western style democracy and capitalism plan" in Iraq and the Middle East.
He also stressed that "we are considering what we can do and how to institutionalize them".
Last year was the "Year of Culture and Education" set by the International Olympic Committee.
With this favorable opportunity, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games has organized a series of educational activities to disseminate advanced culture and popularize Olympic knowledge.
This is a very important achievement.
It provides a vivid description of the knowledge of the Olympic Movement and the essence of the Olympic spirit. It is a good teaching kit that helps to increase the awareness of young students about the Olympic movement and contribute to enhancing the participation of the Olympic Games in the Olympic Games.
Last year, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games also specially designed the curriculum of the Beijing Olympic Games that was produced by recycled paper for young students.
The concept of "Green Olympics" is to prepare and hold the Olympic Games with the idea of protecting the environment, protecting the ecological balance, and so on.
We hope that these curricula will regulate the behaviour of young students, like the prescribed hours, so that they will gradually become the perpetrators and advocates of the "Green Olympics" concept.
Education is one of the core elements of the Olympic Movement and an important manifestation of the "human Olympics."
The real purpose of the Olympic Movement is to contribute to the building of a peaceful and better world by educating young people in a new way, in a new way, and in promoting the harmonious development of young people.
Therefore, the integration of sports and education has not only opened up new horizons for the development of education, but also made the Olympic movement more educational.
The "Green Olympics" is one of the three major concepts of Beijing's hosting of the 2008 Olympic Games.
The core content is to greatly improve the quality of the capital's environment, create a beautiful environment for the Olympic Games, and build an ecological city.
To this end, it is necessary to make extensive use of environmental technologies and means to promote environmental management, urban and rural greening and the development of environmental protection industries on a large scale, continuously enhance the environmental awareness of the whole society, and encourage the public to actively participate in various activities to improve the ecological environment.
Doing a good job in the implementation of the "Green Olympics" is an important task put forward by the third plenary session of the 16th Central Committee of the 16th CPC Central Committee to establish a comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable scientific view of development and to promote the comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable development of the Beijing municipal economy.
We must attach great importance to it.
To achieve the goal of the Green Olympics, Beijing Municipality has formulated the "plan for Olympic action" and "ecological and environmental protection plan" on the basis of the "10th Five-Year Plan" and the "bid report." It has set new goals and plans for environmental construction and protection in the next few years.
The goal of holding a green Olympics will be fully realized through systematic and systematic implementation.
On 25 February, the US State Department issued the "National Human Rights Report 2003" and once again commented on the human rights situation in more than 190 countries and regions, including China.
Of course, there are still countries where the human rights situation has greatly improved, for example, Afghanistan and Iraq, but this is the "credit" of the United States army's overthrow of the former regime and the "liberation" of the two countries.
What about the human rights situation in the United States?
As in previous years, the report does not make a statement.
On 1 March, the Information Office of China's State Council issued the "US human rights record for 2003" to make up for the inadequacy of the US human rights report.
The article was based on a large number of facts and gave an account of the human rights problems in the United States and the violation of the human rights of other countries by the United States.
In the history of the Americans, there is a tradition of good faith and a tradition of making mistakes.
It is a vivid example of the story of George Washington, which is known to have cut the cherry tree as a child.
Now that the United States has become the only superpower in the world, it is not telling the truth.
Recently, there has been a quiet change in reports about China's economic development in the mainstream Japanese media.
Contrary to the previous "China threat", many reports from Japan have begun to believe that China's economic development has promoted the recovery of the Japanese economy, and China's strong market demand has become an important driving force for Japan's economic development.
The US Newsweek also said recently that the rise of China is an opportunity rather than a threat to other countries, especially the neighboring countries.
The "China threat theory", which has been widely circulated, is being replaced by the "theory of China opportunity."
The "China threat theory" asserts that China's development will pose a threat to other countries, especially the neighboring countries.
This assertion, however, was not accepted by China's neighbours.
Malaysian Former Prime Minister Mahathir said that "Asian countries need not be afraid of China's growing military and economic power, because China does not have a tradition of foreign subjugation."
In a vision plan published by the Indian Defense Department, the Indian Ministry of Defense also believes that China has no military threat against India.
In terms of economy and trade, all governments and enterprises have taken China as the best option to expand their markets. Overseas investors with strategic vision have firmly used their actions to write the "theory of China": more than 400 of the 500 strong enterprises in the world have come to invest in China.
China has been in the forefront of attracting foreign capital for several years in a row.
GDP is a key macroeconomic indicator for the world.
It is of utmost importance to maintain the GDP growth in the entire process of modernization of our country.
We must maintain the momentum of rapid economic growth in the light of the fact that China's GDP is growing at a rate of one percentage point each year. This means that we must maintain the momentum of rapid economic growth.
To achieve the grand goal of comprehensively building a well-off society and the realization of the third-step strategic goal of modernization, to a large extent, we have to rely on the sustained and rapid growth of the GDP.
However, we should see that the GDP index is also flawed.
For example, it is not easy to reflect accurately the quality and structure of economic growth, and it is not easy to reflect the level of social welfare actually enjoyed, nor can it accurately measure social distribution and social justice, and so on.
On the other hand, the GDP is not the only one.
In assessing political achievements, we are not simply looking at the growth of the GDP. We also need to look at the actual situation of the people's material and cultural life, look at the employment situation, social security, social order, social management, social harmony, and so on.
Therefore, we should treat the existing GDP accounting system with scientific spirit, scientific attitude and scientific thinking, and show the position of GDP in the overall economic and social development.
At the same time, it is necessary to maintain a certain rate of growth without paying too much attention to it.
The development of the economy and the eradication of poverty are fundamental prerequisites for achieving sustainable development.
Sustainable economic development is the material basis for environmental protection and comprehensive social progress.
If we do not solve the problem of survival, we cannot talk about development, let alone sustainable development.
The promotion of economic development and efforts to eradicate poverty are the only way for developing countries to move towards sustainable development.
In the absence of a solution to the problem of poverty in developing countries, the development of the developed countries could not be sustained.
The rational use of resources and the protection of the environment are essential requirements for achieving sustainable development.
Development cannot be sustained at the cost of wasting resources and sacrificing the environment.
Natural resources are not inexhaustible and inexhaustible, while the demand for human social development is growing. If the relationship between these two areas is not properly handled, it will inevitably lead to the deterioration of the ecological environment and seriously threaten the survival and development of mankind.
Sustainable development can be achieved only through the path of a revolving economy based on the most efficient use of resources and the protection of the environment.
Achieving comprehensive social progress and improving the people's living standards and quality is the ultimate goal of sustainable development.
A year ago, the ninth informal meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) was held on the Bank of the Huangpu River in Shanghai.
Today, we have gathered in the Pacific Ocean, which has beautiful scenery on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, to discuss plans for economic cooperation in Asia and the Pacific.
It is a great pleasure for an old friend to meet.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to President Fox for his kind invitation and the careful arrangements made by the government of Mexico.
Over the past year, the trend of economic globalization has continued to develop, science and technology are advancing with each passing day, bringing new development opportunities to all countries.
At the same time, there has been an increase in uncertainties in global economic development, including a number of countries and regions, including members of APEC, facing new challenges in the course of economic development.
Trade protectionism is on the rise, and there is still a long way to go in achieving free, fair and fair trade.
The struggle against terrorism is a complex and complex one, with an increase in non-traditional security factors.
Our world is still far from tranquil.
Although the international community is faced with such a problem, there may be such unexpected problems in the future, but the tide of peace and development is irreversible, and the aspirations of peoples for a better life remain unchanged.
The theme of this dialogue, with its development as its theme, is very meaningful.
Development is the basis of the progress of human civilization and the key to resolving the various contradictions and problems facing the world.
Lasting peace and stability in the world can be achieved only if there is global coordination, balance and universal development.
We should explore this issue in a comprehensive and in-depth manner and tackle it in a concerted manner.
The accelerated development of economic globalization has become one of the most prominent features of the world economy today.
Driven by the trend of economic globalization, the ties between various countries and regions have become increasingly close, the market is more open, and the flow of capital, technology, and talents has become more extensive and fast. All these have brought unprecedented opportunities for strengthening international cooperation and promoting common development.
At the same time, the development of the trend of economic globalization has also brought severe challenges. The gap between the north and the South is widening. Some developing countries are facing the danger of further marginalization, increasing economic and financial risks, and serious transnational crime. All these have increased the urgency of international cooperation and joint response.
At a time when opportunities and challenges coexist, we should seize opportunities, meet challenges, seek common ground while reserving differences, expand cooperation, and promote economic globalization in the direction of achieving common development and prosperity.
(international) the spread of flu in the United States has reached its peak.
Los Angeles, December 31 (Xinhua) The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention said today that the United States has reached its peak in more than 30 years.
According to the statistics of the center as of 20 December, the number of deaths caused by flu in the United States has reached a record high of 7.8% of all deaths in the same period.
At least 42 children in the United States have died of influenza, and adult deaths have risen rapidly. However, no accurate statistics are available at this time.
Experts believe that there are two reasons for the serious spread of the flu in 2003: first, the flu virus is not the "Panama a" flu virus that was popular in previous years, so that the previously produced vaccines could not effectively prevent the virus.
Despite the fact that an average of 36,000 people die of influenza each year in the United States, 11.04 million people are hospitalized because of the flu. However, it is still very rare for a certain degree of social panic as a result of this flu.
William Thompson, an epidemiological expert in the United States, believes that this flu is the most serious in the United States in more than 30 years, and is even earlier than in previous years. In many schools, large areas of flu have spread, and many places for influenza vaccination have been lined up.
In the face of such a grim situation, the US Department of Health activated the emergency treatment center on 19 December and dispatched medical expert groups to various states.

According to the report, in December last year, the services sector, including the retail, financial, construction and other non-manufacturing sectors, fell from 60.1 in the previous month to 58.6, while the economist originally estimated that the index would rise to 60.5.

NEW YORK, January 8 (Xinhua) The exchange rate of the United States dollar fell to an all-time low on the 8th after a flash in the morning, according to a statement by the governor of the Central Bank of Europe.
The European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trey, said on the same day that the excessively high euro exchange rate had a negative impact on European enterprises' exports, but he believed that the gradual recovery of the world economy and the transfer of consumer demand had partially offset the impact of the appreciation of the euro.
He also pointed out that the strong euro also, to a certain degree, has a positive effect on the stability of prices in the euro zone. Therefore, the European Central Bank has decided to maintain the original interest rate level.
Investors view this comment as a signal that euro zone officials are not worried about the appreciation of the euro, thus causing the dollar to drop in the United States dollar against other major western currencies. The British pound has risen to a new high for 11 years.
The value of the U S dollar against the United States dollar fell from 1 1 to 1.182 to 1: 1.187. The United States dollar against the United States dollar fell from 1: 1.2398 to 1: 1.2217. The United States dollar was down from 1: 1.2398 to 1: 1.2267.

When talking about the threats and pressure faced by Lebanon and Syria, Lahoud said that the purpose of threatening and exerting pressure on both Lebanon and Syria is to urge them to change the principles of the nation and the country.
These principles reflect the common aspirations of the Lebanese and Syrian peoples in the liberation of the occupied territories, the right of return of the Palestinian people, the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and opposition to the local settlement of Palestinian refugees.
He condemned the Israeli government of Sharon for obstructing and undermining the peace efforts and refusing to implement the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.

Albright arrived in Beirut on the evening of 11 July for a visit to Lebanon after concluding his visit to Syria.
(international) Syria calls on Israel to seriously deal with peace
United Nations, January 12 (Xinhua) Israel must give serious consideration to the issue of achieving peace and return the Golan Heights under its occupation to Syria.
Mekdad said that unless Israel "seriously respects" the resolutions of the UN Security Council calling for Israeli troops to withdraw from the Golan Heights, there is little influence on the invitation of Israeli President Katsav.
He stressed that only if Israel does this can there be peace, and Syria will not sacrifice its own territory in any case.
Mekdad pointed out that the role of the President of Israel was primarily a courtesy, and that Israel was truly responsible for the cabinet members led by Prime Minister Sharon.
He said: "We will not negotiate with the president of Israel. This is a matter of negotiation with the Israeli government."
Earlier, Israeli President Katsav suddenly announced through a public radio that he would invite Syrian President Bashar to travel to Jerusalem to hold talks with Israeli leaders.
In regard to this, Syria believes that it is only a News speculation.
Recently, Syria has strengthened its diplomatic offensive against Israel and hopes to resume peace talks between the two countries.
However, Sharon said that only Syria showed willingness to put an end to terrorism and that the two countries could resume peace talks.

(international) the two black spots of the Red Sea crash have been found.
CAIRO, January 17 (Xinhua) The first black box of the crashed passenger plane was found in the Red Sea on the 17th by a joint search and rescue team from Egypt and France.
Hamdy Sami, head of the Egyptian search team, said that the second black box of the French diving robot is recovering its second black box, which is expected to be recovered early on the 18th local time.

China's ultra low temperature Index calls for breakthroughs in conservation and reforestation technology
Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, January 18 (reporter Su Wanming).
A few days ago, Chinese scholars announced that they had made a major breakthrough in low-temperature conservation and reforestation technology.
A few days ago, the Shandong Provincial Hospital, which has been successfully executed for five days, has succeeded in carrying out the operation. This is the second case following the successful operation of the hospital last year.
The new consultancy report of the medical and health science and technology project of the Ministry of Health confirmed that to date there have been only two cases in the world which have been successfully carried out after super low temperatures.
Wang added: "after a large number of experiments in animal experiments and clinical applications of two cases, we have begun to have a preliminary understanding of the use of low-temperature conservation techniques."
Wang added that compared to the heart and the kidneys, the composition and structure of the fingers are even more complicated.
This has led to a series of complex aspects, such as the preparation of cold storage tanks, the freezing of organs, rehabilitation, replanting, and the prevention and treatment of injuries.
The technology has provided important lessons for research related to the long-term conservation and successful revival of other organs of the human body.

(international) economic experts predicted that the United States is the biggest winner in the depreciation of the US dollar.
Davos, Switzerland, January 23 (Xinhua) The fourth annual meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland, today held a special discussion on the trend of depreciation of the US dollar. Some experts predicted that the United States would be the biggest winner in the US dollar exchange rate.
Most economists attending the meeting argued that US officials, including US Treasury Secretary John Snow, seem to have abandoned the "strong US dollar policy" pursued in recent years.
The fall of the US dollar exchange rate will provide the United States with greater space for economic development and more employment opportunities. This is evident in the manufacturing industry.
At the same time, the depreciation of the US dollar made US products more competitive in domestic and foreign markets, which helped the United States to fill its trade deficit.
However, experts believe that a weak US dollar will also have a negative impact on the US.
First of all, the US stock market is likely to remain stagnant and the value of various types of investment will drop. Foreign investors will withdraw their funds because they are worried about a further drop in the US dollar. Second, it will eventually lead to a drop in the standard of living of the Americans. Third, the sharp depreciation of the US dollar may lead to trade and financial turmoil.
However, the impact of the devaluation of the United States dollar on Europe, Japan and Canada is even more serious.
Following the fall in the exchange rate of the United States dollar, there was an increase in the pressure on European commodity exports, which put the European economy at risk of being pushed into a total recession.

In terms of exports, last year Japan's exports to the United States declined by 9.8 percent over the previous year, but exports to Asia grew by 12.9 percent.
This not only made up for the drop in Japan's exports to the United States, but also caused Japan's total exports last year to grow by 4.7 percent over the previous year, reaching a record high of 545.58 trillion yen.
In terms of imports, due to the increase in energy demand such as oil and natural gas and the rise in prices, the total import volume of Japan in 2003 was 5% higher than in the previous year, reaching 443320 trillion yen, also setting a record high.
In 2003, Japan's trade surplus was 10.2387 trillion yen, an increase of 3.6 percent over the previous year, and again broke through the 10 trillion yen mark in three years.
The number of private enterprises in Guangdong exceeds the state and its holding enterprises for the first time.
GUANGZHOU, January 26 (Xinhua) The number of private enterprises in Guangdong Province surpassed the state and its holding enterprises for the first time in 2003, according to reports from the Guangdong Provincial Bureau of Commerce and Industry.
According to statistics, by the end of 2003, there were 690,000 enterprises (including domestic, private and foreign-invested enterprises) in the province, an increase of 0.59 percent over the end of last year.
Among them, 31.60 million domestic enterprises fell by 16.4 percent from the end of the previous year. The registered capital grew by 0.9 percent and 33.8 percent respectively. The registered capital was 5.62 billion yuan, and the registered capital increased by 3.6 percent and 4.1 percent respectively.
For the first time, the number of households in the private sector exceeds the state and its holding enterprises.
In the course of restructuring the state and its holding enterprises, although the number of households has decreased, their strength has gradually increased, and the total registered capital (gold) has increased by 20 percentage points compared to the end of 2002.
According to statistics, the total number of newly registered enterprises in the province in 2003 was 1,050,000, showing a drop of two litres.
Among them, there were 70,000 domestic enterprises, a drop of 17.6% over the same period last year. The number of private enterprises was 8.16 million, and the number of foreign funded enterprises was 6561. The year-on-year increase was 29 percent and 0.08 percent respectively.
The proportion of domestic, private and foreign-invested enterprises as a proportion of the total number of newly registered enterprises was 16 8: 6.
(international) WTO has submitted a "Byrd subsidy" dispute to arbitration for settlement
GENEVA, January 26 (Xinhua) The World Trade Organization (WTO) announced today that the European Union (EU) and seven other WTO members have called for sanctions to be imposed on the United States.
This complaint of sanctions stems from the failure of the United States to repeal the Byrd amendment within the deadline set by the WTO.
The "Byrd Amendment" passed by the US Congress in 2000 demanded that the US government direct the punitive taxes collected in the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases directly to American companies whose interests have been damaged, instead of handing over to the US Treasury Department.
This move by the United States was opposed by major trading partners such as the European Union and Japan.
In January 2003, the WTO finally decided that the amendment would violate global trade rules and requested the United States to repeal it by 27 December of that year.
However, the United States has not implemented the WTO ruling.
To this end, the European Union, Japan, Canada, Brazil, India, South Korea, Mexico and Chile have recently applied to the WTO for approval to impose additional tariffs on some products from the United States equivalent to that of the United States government.
However, the United States subsequently questioned the extent of the sanctions and the legality of the pleadings.
(Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan) Hong Kong's spring festival retail business rises by 10%
Hong Kong, January 28 (Xinhua) retail sales in Hong Kong increased by 10 percent in the first half of the lunar new year, according to the Hong Kong Retail Management Association.
Mr Yu, chairman of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, said that the travel of mainland tourists to Hong Kong has given impetus to Hong Kong's consumer sentiment. During this year's Spring Festival, the retail sales of some industries, such as jewellery and clothing, have increased by 20% to 30%. Among these, Mainland visitors account for about 10% of the total turnover.
He said that the use of the renminbi cards by mainland visitors in Hong Kong has clearly stimulated the Chinese New Year market, with an average of $3,000 for each visit and an extra $10,000 for individual visitors from the mainland.
Last year, Hong Kong was affected by SARS, with total retail sales falling by 4%.
Yu Pang-chun predicts that with the recovery of the economy, the total retail performance of Hong Kong will grow at a single digit level this year, but the prices of goods will also rise as a result of rising costs.
He believed that Hong Kong's deflation would be improved this year.
(international) Denmark introduces new bill to restrict immigration
STOCKHOLM, January 28 (Xinhua) The Danish government today introduced a new bill to restrict immigration.
According to the act, children of foreign immigrants born in Denmark will no longer enjoy the right to automatically acquire Danish nationality.
The bill is the latest in a series of measures introduced by the leader of Denmark's Liberal Party, Rasmussen, since he took office as prime minister in November 2001.
It is reported that the bill is likely to be passed in parliament because the Liberal Party has the support of the right-wing Danish People's Party on the issue of immigration.
The act requires children of foreigners born in Denmark to apply for nationality in the same way as other immigrants, instead of automatically acquiring nationality.
Migrants who have acquired nationality will be deprived of their nationality if they commit a criminal offence that poses a serious threat to society.
Over the past two years, the government of Denmark has introduced a series of measures to limit immigration, including restrictions on the granting of permanent residence permits and restrictions on the entry of families into Denmark.
As a result of the unpopular attitude of the government of Denmark towards immigrants, the number of foreign asylum-seekers in Denmark fell from 14,347 in 1993 to 3,500 in 2003.
As a result, the image of freedom and human rights, which Denmark has always advocated, has suffered as a result.
What Singapore has achieved cannot be taken for granted.
Even with the development of science and technology, I do not believe that people can maintain an ideal environment of higher standards of living and quality, full employment and increasing salaries, without working hard, maintaining social discipline and adapting to changes.
These beautiful things are not automatically available.
Only when people understand that they must focus on the interests of the community and make difficult compromises, as well as the necessary adjustments, will it be possible to have a better future for all.
What will Singapore do after one or two decades?
We all hope to see the future, but it is difficult to predict the future.
Many factors are not under the control of Singapore.
The development of many things depends on the development of the world situation.
We do not know when problems will arise.
For example, three Singaporeans travel to Hong Kong, and as a result, they are infected with the sand virus, which is unpredictable.
In the less than one month after the Spring Festival, three extremely serious security incidents have occurred in China, with dozens of people killed each time.
The frequency of accidents is high, and the loss of life is deplorable.
In the past few months, the Chongqing natural gas pipeline accident, the gas explosion of several coal mines, and frequent vicious traffic accidents have led to the deaths of several hundred people.
China is vast and densely populated, and the probability of a disaster is greater than that of other countries. It can easily lead to the death of dozens of people and even hundreds of people. This is a reality that cannot be achieved in terms of objective conditions.
However, based on common sense, the death toll in China is still too frequent.
In many disasters, there was a large number of fires, explosion of coal mines, explosion of firecrackers, and passenger traffic accidents.
This shows at least two problems, one of which is the weakness of security measures in these areas and the fact that people have not learned from the tragedies of the past, thus perpetuating the recurrence of similar incidents.
At a time of rapid economic growth in Singapore, there have also been serious fires. The painful memories are still deep, but it has also quickly raised Singapore's awareness of the safety of public places.
At present, China is also in an extraordinary period of rapid economic growth and great social transformation.
There have been frequent incidents of accidents involving foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong, although this figure is not too high. However, according to the relatively safe environment in which domestic helpers work in the family, the occurrence of accidents is far from being in line with the nature of their work.
According to information, from January 1999 to June 2003, a total of 99 female domestic helpers died in accidents.
Behind these figures is a broken family that cannot wait until the daughter and mother go home, an unfortunate tragedy that should be avoided, and, at the same time, we must do everything we can to reduce the number of regrets to the minimum.
According to a recent announcement by the Indonesian embassy, since 1999, 96 Indonesian maids have lost their lives while working in Singapore. Some of them died in high-rise buildings.
The Indonesian government has, from time to time, expressed its dissatisfaction and has repeatedly formulated new regulations to tighten control over the quality of local Indonesian maids and to ensure the safety of domestic helpers. However, the problem has not been solved.
People have to be deeply troubled by the fact that, compared to the number of casualties on construction sites, the number of accidents involving domestic helpers is even higher. This means that people have no choice but to think about the background and the reasons.
Chen Kongli, an expert on Taiwan issues at home and abroad in mainland China, has recently published a new piece of "observation of Taiwan."
Most of the articles in the book were written in March 2000 after the first change of political party in Taiwan. Until Chen Shui-bian put forward the theory of "one country, one country," it was the author's observation and reflection on Taiwan's internal situation and cross-strait relations.
The articles written two years ago can only be published two years later. It is obvious that the mainland's review of the literature on Taiwan is very complicated and the process is long, and it is not easy to "observe Taiwan."
In observing and studying the Taiwan issue over a long period of time, Chen has always sought truth from facts and seeking truth from facts.
After reading this book, this feature is even more impressive.
Since the early 1980s, research on the Taiwan issue has become the mainland's "learning." All kinds of research institutes have emerged, and all kinds of scholars and experts have made their appearance.
In overseas countries, Taiwan's research institutions on the mainland are generally divided into north and south.
The northern faction's position is relatively close to the government, and its remarks are rather tough. In some specific historical stages or in the course of major political developments, it has shown more aggressive Hawks.
Taiwanese research institutes in the south are mainly located in areas south of the Yangtze River, including Shanghai and Fujian.
Japanese media reported that the "academic qualifications" of Japan's "two years of study in London" were exaggerated by the Japanese media.
Japan's "Post Weekly" confirmed to the Department of Education of the University of London that Koizumi had only attended several classes in the United Kingdom for nine months and had not received any degree.
This scandal has been reported or reprinted by large and small media in China, allowing the vast number of compatriots to be very happy.
Indeed, the prime minister of a country has fabricated a false academic qualification to deceive the people of his country.
In particular, Japan, which occurred in "imperialism," is also a loss of face.
However, if we can change from one angle, we may see some positive significance from this scandal.
Moreover, these positive things are precisely what we lack, and we are in urgent need of improvement.
In recent years, we have been advocating "good faith". We have to "create a sunshine government." We must respect the "right to know" of the public and enhance the "transparency" of the administration. However, there is still a wide gap between the ideal and the ideal.
If you think about it, a national Prime Minister's diploma is not a big deal, but it can be exposed by the media.
In such a country, what else can't be "sunshine"?
In Taiwan's election rallies, all the major camps will use tour buses to transfer the people to the venue. However, the recent situation is that Chen Shui-bian's evening show is more than that of Lien and Soong, and it is obviously deserted.
Not long ago, when Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian went to a rally in the north and shouted "a garlic (elected)", half of the people in the crowd did not give face to them.
If there is no accident, when Taiwan's presidential election enters the countdown period, from public opinion polls to underground openings, it should be possible to assume that Chen Lu will lose.
Chen Shui-bian, who has managed to win the popular support of the Pan-Blue Camp over the past four years, has proved that he cannot effectively win the popular support of the people in the past four years, and has weakened the confidence of his supporters.
How should Beijing treat the Pan-Blue forces that may return to power?
First of all, it should be understood that the Pan-Blue Camp, which is likely to regain power, is no longer the sole party of the Kuomintang. It is a combination of blue and blue, as well as the integration of the internal tradition and the local faction.
The close cooperation in the election period should not be regarded as an inevitable relationship in the future.
If there is hope of winning the election, it will definitely take some time for internal integration. The year-end election of the Legislative Yuan will also make it very difficult for Lien and Soong to make too significant changes in cross-strait relations.
Unless it can realize that the improvement of cross-strait relations can add to Taiwan's internal politics and be confident that it can achieve results within a short period of time, the most important thing is to let the people feel this result.
Based on this background, Beijing should postpone the move of promoting reunification and promote the internal situation of Lien and Soong as the leader of the "traditional blue camp."
It has been more than half a century since the first nuclear explosion was carried out by the United States in New Mexico in July 1945 and two atomic bombs were dropped on Japan in August of the same year.
Although the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union has resulted in the accumulation of nuclear weapons to the point of destroying the world as a whole, it is fortunate that both sides recognize the danger of nuclear war and refrain from pressing the nuclear button.
After the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War era, the danger of a large-scale nuclear war has basically been eliminated.
At the same time, however, the risk of nuclear proliferation has not been reduced but has increased.
This proliferation is manifested in two ways.
First, some countries with considerable resources and strength have sought to manufacture and possess nuclear weapons through various means in the interests of regional hegemony, confrontation with neighbouring countries, maintenance of security or the pursuit of blackmail diplomacy.
The other is that certain non-state groups, especially Islamic extremist forces with strong hatred towards the western world, are doing everything possible to seek small nuclear weapons, at the expense of a large number of innocent people and carrying out bloody terrorist activities against the West.
Under this demand, intermediaries engaged in the transfer and trading of nuclear weapons and related technologies have emerged and their scale is expanding to become an important component of nuclear proliferation in the world today.
As a Chinese who grew up in the Lake of Hangzhou, the image of the countryside in the south of the Yangtze River and the life of the peasants in the old days still remains in my memory.
When they returned to their hometown after a long period of time, they found that in the farmland with full eyes and green along the Shanghai and Shanghai highways, there were always three layers of houses built by the peasants. However, they seldom saw people working in the land.
This is really surprising to me. It is hard to believe that there will be such a big change in my own land, which is still alive in a foreign country.
Recently, however, a number of reports on the study of the situation in the rural areas of China, which have been seen on the Internet, have caused a great deal of surprise and shock.
It is hard to imagine that China's rural areas still have such an unimaginable dark side, and Chinese farmers have also lived a life of humiliation and hardship.
The "China Rural Survey," published by Chen Guidi and his wife in the rural areas of Anhui, Henan, and Hebei, published a lengthy report on "China's rural survey," which has caused a sensation in Chinese society.
They came to the conclusion that "when we come to the Chinese farmers, we feel that we can't imagine what you can imagine.
This is really a statement of blood and blood.
As expected, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah announced the dissolution of parliament the day before yesterday. The next general election will be held in the near future.
For Abdullah, this election will be an event of great significance in his political career, and the results of this election are equally symbolic in terms of the political situation in Malaysia and its development trend.
Abdullah took over the leadership in November last year, and so far only four months have passed.
In spite of this, he still decided to dissolve the parliament and hold the general election ahead of schedule.
This includes at least two meanings: first, Abdullah is satisfied with the performance of his administration in the past four months and is full of confidence in the voters' voting intention. Second, he hopes to consolidate his power base so that he can walk out of the shadow of Mahathir.
There is no doubt that the decision taken by Abdullah to hold a flash election shows that he has made a comprehensive assessment of the domestic political situation.
Malaysia's current economic performance is good, and there are no issues that can be used by opposition parties for speculation and use.
Not only that, since he took office, he has taken some measures of higher visibility in the area of corruption, including the arrest and prosecution of the former minister of Land and Cooperative Development.
At the same time, he called for greater efficiency in the civil service. This is also an encouragement to the people.
Since its birth, the growth and stereotypes of the European Union have been strongly influenced by French politics and culture.
To strive for independence and autonomy in foreign affairs, the attitude and approach to world affairs should be different from that of the United States. This is the direction of the EU's foreign policy and can clearly see the shadow of France.
For this reason, the international community, including China, Russia and the Arab countries, would like to see the emergence of the EU, hoping to see a completely independent force in international exchanges.
It must be acknowledged that the EU has indeed been working in this direction since the late 1980s.
In December 1992, the EU heads of state agreed at the Maastricht summit that all member states would implement a unified foreign policy in order to speak out with the same calibre.
However, two years later, in dealing with the Bosnian issue, the so-called "unified foreign policy" was completely defeated for the first time.
From the Maastricht summit until today, it can be said that EU diplomacy, which has lasted for ten years, has not been good enough.
In particular, the EU's foreign policy cannot stand the test of major events.
The different positions taken by member states regarding the US-Iraq war have not only proved this point, but have once again fully exposed the politically fatal flaws in the European Union. That is, it is easy to be controlled by other big powers and be controlled by each other.
On 24 February, President Bush announced at the White House that he would support a constitutional amendment to prohibit homosexual marriage.
This is a significant change in his ambiguous attitude on this issue over the past few months, representing an important development in the US election year.
This constitutional amendment to ban homosexual marriage is a very powerful political weapon in the southern United States of the United States, but it also has a great negative effect. That is, in the United States, this is a heavy pound of cultural controversy in the United States, which will undoubtedly intensify the polarization of the US politics and further distance the two sides of the strait.
For Bush himself, who claimed that he was a "solidarity" and not a "divided person" during the general election in 2000, his words were obviously different.
In addition, the position of the younger generation in the United States on the issue of homosexuality is becoming more and more open. Although this move by Bush will be effective in the short term, it will harm the long-term interests of the Republican Party.
Bush's new "amendment to the constitution" can be called the "scorched earth strategy" of this year's presidential election.
Bush adopted this strategy because he is increasingly vulnerable to the two important issues of "anti-terrorism" war and economy and employment, and has no choice but to open up a new battlefield on the topic of religious culture that divides public opinion in China.
The attitude of the United States so far has remained cautious.
That is to say, since the maintenance of the status quo in the Taiwan Strait can satisfy the long-term goal of the United States in carrying out strategic checks and balances on the mainland, the United States must avoid political and military conflicts with China as a result of encouraging Taiwan independence.
It can be imagined that the United States cannot completely eliminate the space for holding a referendum in Taiwan in accordance with Beijing's requirements. However, out of considerations of its own interests, it will also take some early warning actions.
Recently, US Secretary of State Powell took the initiative to reiterate the established policy toward Taiwan and took the initiative to show US opposition to Taiwan independence.
This kind of attitude has been interpreted by outsiders as aimed at containing and preventing Chen Shui-bian from getting involved in fire.
Some of the remarks recently made by some think tank figures in the United States, as well as the recent dispatch of a large number of spy ships to the Taiwan Strait to detect military developments on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, have indirectly proved that the United States is very concerned about the situation in the Taiwan Strait.
From another perspective, it shows that although the United States will not completely stop Taiwan from holding a referendum in accordance with Beijing's requirements, it is also concerned about the uncertainty of the situation in the Taiwan Strait during this period.
In the end, any large-scale and one-to-one elections can only produce a result. Either Chen Shui-bian is lucky enough to be re-elected, or Lien Chan has returned to the Taiwan presidential palace.
What worries us is that under the conditions of asymmetry in the dissemination of information, it seems that people from all walks of life in the mainland still do not have the psychological preparation for Chen Shui-bian's victory.
If the result of the election is not forthcoming, it will once again plunge Beijing into an unnecessary passive position.
The Arabic saying goes: "The chaos on one day is even more frightening than that of a thousand years."
Is this what the northeast Asian countries are worried about now?
I think the answer is probably yes.
In a recent study, a well-known research and development center, which is close to Washington and funded by the government of the United States, has explored four options for decision-making on the Korean nuclear crisis, namely, interaction, containment, economic sanctions and pre-emptive attacks.
The attitude of the countries of the region to these strategies is the focus of the survey.
In addition, the investigation also analyses the threat posed by the North Korean nuclear weapons programme in the light of the potential and possible damage to nuclear weapons attacks by the people of neighbouring countries.
China and Russia feel that the danger of North Korea using nuclear weapons is low or low, while Japan and South Koreans believe that the threat is very large.
All the northeast Asian countries agree to maintain contact with North Korea.
Japan, on the other hand, supports the containment. Other countries also think that under certain circumstances, the strategy of containment is acceptable.
Singapore is very much concerned about the international rankings and has paid close attention to all categories of countries put forward by European and American institutions.
From time to time, we are always at the top of the list. Naturally, we have also increased our interest in ranking.
But there is also a lot of trouble.
People in general think that paying too much attention to ranking is afraid of losing, indicating that they are proud of their rankings.
As a result, people say that we should be more graceful. It is best to be able to compete with the rest of the world.
In view of the fact that many people in the past did not even look at the rankings, a wonderful phenomenon emerged: people seem to no longer look at the "world's first" as good news, but rather more inclined to regard it as an embarrassing thing.
However, the situation has changed over the past year or two.
We have doubts about the long-term competitiveness of our country, and people from all walks of life are worried about their rice bowls.
With this concern, we are no longer so graceful.
The fierce competition in the international arena is likely to lead others to catch up, and it is easy for them to turn out to be backward in one way or another.
On the face of it, Bush is still quite angry with Cheney. At the end of last month, Bush also solemnly pledged that Cheney is not a candidate for the vice president.
But he also jokingly said that, as in the year 2000, he had appointed Cheney as his candidate for vice president.
Cheney, who has always maintained a low profile and maintained a low profile, has recently made frequent appearances in the media and denied that it would be replaced.
But he stayed for himself.
He said that if he had a health problem or felt that he had really become a burden for the president, he would find it hard to get back.
Cheney was 63 years old and had four heart disease records.
Recently, it has been widely rumored that the US military has already besieged the "September 11 black sheep", which is just waiting for the time to catch up.
The presidential election was held on 2 November, and it is said that the Pentagon has arranged for a drama to be staged in October.
However, in the early days of the night, there would be plenty of trouble in the future.
It seems that Zhu Liani is a trump card for Bush's fight for comparative insurance for votes.
Participants in the 2004 US presidential election have already decided: Democratic candidate G\ x {5ee5}, challenging the current president of the Republican Party, Bush.
They started to carry out "warm-up activities" such as advertising and election debate before the general election in November.
They will probably confront the three major issues of war, economy and society with words and words.
Bush is of the view that the war is closely related to the national security of the United States. In order to ensure the security of the United States, he keeps telling people: "We are in the midst of war."
Kerry will naturally point out that Bush's abuse of Iraq's erroneous intelligence of possessing weapons of mass destruction is not the result of the war against Iraq.
Speaking of the economy, Kerry believed that Bush's tax cut plan was beneficial to the rich and could not create new employment opportunities.
Bush asked him to see: the current US economic data are not out of the air, aren't they?
As far as social issues are concerned, as far as the relationship between women and men is concerned, Bush opposes homosexual marriage, opposes abortion, and supports the death penalty.
How will Bush and Kerry make their respective views on these three major issues and convince the voters through advertisements, television, and speeches? This is the political show that they have to perform in the next eight months.
However, in the field of foreign affairs, Kerry has more room for acting.
According to information, young people who choose to commit suicide are mostly young people between the ages of 15 and 19, but there is no shortage of young people between the ages of 10 and 14.
It is generally believed that academic pressure is the result of the suicide of children and young people. However, the study has found that emotional problems, especially between men and women, and their relationship with their parents, are the main reasons for young people to find their own way.
The gap between academic pressure and expectations is, of course, also in the area of communication between parents and children.
The pressure of further studies is an unavoidable burden for local children. Sometimes, the pressure is given to the children themselves, and the parents are often forced by their parents to do so.
When parents ask their children to achieve good results, they often make comparisons with other children and ask their children to improve themselves. Of course, there is no small pressure, but the direction of communication and communication at the back of the pressure is the measurement of the relationship between children and children.
If the child's performance is not satisfactory, the parents make silent criticisms, or even give the children the impression that they are disappointed, and even let the children feel that they are disappointed. There is no doubt that the children will be pushed into a desperate situation where they have nowhere to turn to.
It is understood that many young students who are in need of counselling have been forced into a dead end by the high expectations of their parents.
The success and rapid development of Singapore have made parents feel that the material conditions of their children are much better than they used to be. It is inevitable that their children should perform better than themselves.
Usually, when parents forget that they are still children, the performance of various parties may not be particularly outstanding.
By the age of one and a half, the vast majority of children were sent to the nurseries of various institutions to implement the system. The authorities only made a symbolic collection of child care fees, and the children would only go home for a week or even a month.
Today, Singapore is facing a social problem of declining fertility and an ageing population.
In order to maintain modern living standards and fashionable material, the younger generation still have the energy to respond to the government's call for early marriage and early childbearing.
This writer has a bold suggestion: the government will come forward to receive new children.
People in Taiwan only take care of their health, and don't have to worry about raising problems.
On the one hand, the government has set up a comprehensive system of nursery kindergartens, replacing primary schools with whole-day schooling, and even providing a three-meal service for a symbolic collection of the expenses incurred by the citizens.
This will not only solve the unemployment problem of the unemployed, but also do not have to worry about the effectiveness of such initiatives as infant bonuses, increased maternity leave, the quality of domestic helpers, tax rebates, and so on.
What Beijing needs to do is not only to serve as the leader of the six-party talks, but also to focus on the long-term interests of China on the Korean Peninsula, take precautions for the future, and carry out strategic deployment as soon as possible.
In particular, Beijing, on the one hand, wants to urge the DPRK to give up nuclear disarmament on the one hand, and, on the other hand, take the road of modern civilization, remove the danger of nuclear war in Northeast Asia, and maintain the status quo on the Korean Peninsula.
There is a strong desire to develop the economy and to integrate into the international community.
But this desire is often manifested through Intrepid, irrational and, in some cases, totally incompatible with international rules.
In fact, for some time now, Beijing has used its influence and financial means to force Pyongyang to change its position that it does not conform to international rules.
This action, however, needs to be planned in a comprehensive manner.
Beijing's aid to Pyongyang should not be limited to the economic level. It should also be extended to other areas of society. It should not be limited to Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program, but should also focus on bringing it into the path of modern civilization.
As soon as Kerry began to enter the arena, no one was optimistic about him. At that time, all the focus was on the former governor of Vermont.
However, in January, prior to the holding of the parliamentary party meeting in the state of clothing, Kerry's victory came to an end, winning the most crucial political party meetings and the primaries in the two states, the state of clothing and the state of New Hampshire.
In the following counties, Kerry basically has not lost his hand, and those who have lost their hands are all due to the fact that the state has its own candidates to run in the election.
Kerry took only six weeks to turn from a candidate with almost no future to the last candidate. All his competitors, including geplat, Liberman, Clark, Dian, and Edwards, have joined the horse. This cannot but make people look at the political charm of Kerry.
In the 19 years of Senator's career, Kerry has always supported abortion and environmental protection policies, opposed tax cuts that benefited the rich, and sought to raise the minimum wage in the hope of solving the problem of global warming.
His work experience in Washington showed that he was willing to directly face social problems, to challenge authority, and to pursue values without fear of offending the interests of a small group of people.
China's reform and opening up policy begins with agriculture, and the rural residents are the earliest beneficiaries of this policy.
However, in the aftermath of the 1990s, agricultural reform was basically in a state of stagnation, and the gap between urban and rural areas was widening.
As time goes by, China has seen two completely different worlds. One is a highly prosperous city, and one is a poor and backward village.
In the Chinese government's words, the widening gap between the rich and the poor in China's urban and rural areas is "the issue of development," so it is still necessary to resolve the problem through sustainable development.
That is to say, China's coastal areas and cities should continue to develop, and should not be burdened by rural problems.
However, when we see that some big cities can change over a year or three, people cannot help asking: Why has there been little change in some of the poor areas over the past few decades?
Of course, the development path of urban and rural areas is very different. This is a fact that should be acknowledged. The question is whether the rural population, which accounts for 70 percent of the total population of the country, has received attention and attention at a time when large amounts of funds have been invested in urban construction and encouraged and supported by the wealthy middle class.
In theory, successive Chinese governments have not paid much attention to the issues of agriculture, rural areas, and peasants.
However, over the years, the situation in rural areas has become increasingly difficult and deteriorating, which is indicative of the increasing importance attached to it.
In any country, public, inspection, and law should be the symbol of justice and justice and the most important system for safeguarding social stability.
Unfortunately, China has become a symbol of corruption in China.
According to a recent report by the National Audit Office, the results of the review of the financial expenses of the public security organs in 26 provinces and cities last year showed that the total amount of public security violations in the country amounted to 16.5 billion yuan.
The crisis of trust in the public, the inspection, and the law has become more and more open.
This profound distrust is reflected in the incident of Liu Yong, the Sun Zhigang incident, and the recent "BMW" incident in Heilongjiang.
The "BMW" incident is even more typical.
People's concern about this issue far exceeds that of "SARS" during the "SARS" period.
In fact, people's concern is no longer the "BMW" incident itself, but rather an expression of mistrust of the entire judicial system.
The departments concerned are very clear about this, and so soon they have taken measures to block the media.
However, the problem is still there.
The second round of six-party talks on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue concluded with general expectations.
During the talks, the parties concerned made contacts and tests on the external problems of the nuclear crisis on the peninsula and reached a consensus on the holding of the third round of talks and the establishment of a working group by the end of June this year.
However, on the question of how North Korea should abandon its nuclear weapons development program and how the United States should ensure the political and military security of the DPRK and the provision of energy aid to the DPRK, the talks not only failed to make any progress, but also gave people the feeling of "dead knot."
Neither the DPRK nor the United States has shown concessions, and the basic positions of both sides have not been relaxed.
However, it is remarkable that in this meeting, the United States has displayed an attitude that is not anxious to solve the problem, and has given people an impression that it is "dragging its feet".
Such a strategy, as demonstrated by the United States, is closely related to the new developments in the current international situation and the benefits it seeks to achieve in these new developments.
Ever since Roosevelt was president, the United States has never had such a large number of company owners in jail.
Is this a coincidence, or is it that the public and the investors have been able to tolerate corporate crime and other illegal acts over the past three years, and the concentration of these crimes has recently been brought to light?
The answer may not be simple, but it is a fact that the criminal acts of many companies have been exposed recently.
This augurs well for the recovery of the economy and, in particular, the restoration of investment confidence.
The end of the 1990s may be one of the most chaotic and elusive stages in US commercial history. The sooner the impact is gone, the better.
After the dust has settled, the names of some companies will inevitably fall into history. In the end, they can only be found in the textbooks of the School of Business.
Other companies, such as Thailand and MCI, under the leadership of the new management team, will try to restructure to welcome the arrival of a new round of economic growth.
When will the new round of economic growth come?
As a CEO, you may not have the answer.
This does not matter, because US Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan does not know the answer.
The Bush administration wants to use Keynes to stimulate the economy. On the one hand, it has made great efforts to increase expenditure (especially national defense expenditures), and on the other hand, it has substantially reduced taxes.
On the international front, the Bush administration continues to promote free trade, but the trade deficit has reached a new high of 5 49 billion US dollars.
After a substantial tax cut, there was no significant increase in investment and consumption.
The new Keynes school, represented by a famous British economist, wyme godley, believes that the US economy is already in a predicament, and Bush's financial strategy has gone back a long way.
They are of the view that the so-called "market discipline" is only an illusion. It will inevitably lead to the benefit of a small number of people, most of whom are at a loss.
In the past, it was felt that, on a global scale, the so-called profitable minorities were in the United States, and most of them were in the developing countries.
This is not the case now.
Many people in the economic circles in the United States believe that India and China, in addition to the multinational companies based in the United States, are also in a prominent position.
The Indian occupation of the service economy and China's occupation of the manufacturing sector.
People focus their attention on the massive transfer of funds and equipment from the United States to China, but they do not see the advantage of China's high level and low income labour market.
First, the current situation in Taiwan is outside Beijing's estimate or in Beijing.
Beijing's estimate is that only it is clear about it, but the results are likely to be refined by others.
Over the past four years, the pro-independence camp of Chen Shui-bian, Annette Lu, and the pro-independence camp have made positive remarks and acted diligently, and the Taiwan independence movement has made positive progress.
On the other hand, Beijing seems to be indifferent to the progress of Taiwan independence, except for occasional soprano.
But since the autumn of last year, it has become completely different, as if the cart had changed into a car. In the past few months, it was clear that the handling capacity was very different from that of the 1990s.
From this we can infer that the current situation in Taiwan is within its estimate.
Second, let's look at Taiwan's diplomacy.
Regarding the development of the Taiwan strait situation, we should see that the attitude of the United States and other major countries is relatively close to Beijing and is relatively close to Taipei.
Since the attitudes of all countries are open to the public, the answer is clear.
So far, the countries and Beijing have not only become relatively close to each other, they have more specific ties with Taipei, and have a relatively small number of differences. Moreover, they have also begun to give advice on Taiwan democracy, which has always been praised for a long time.
